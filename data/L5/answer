best is to deal with people you know i have a friend who tried this and by the time the legal fees were done the backstabbing etc he really had nothing left for a profit a lot of people ask family and friends for support as in business there are so many who are there for the power not profit in business as well if they develop your patent they can win the lawsuit simply on the grounds that you cannot afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees a lot of patents are blatantly and flagrantly stolen in this way if you can t afford to defend your patent the patent laws mean nothing to you in fact your better off without a patent on the other hand there may be a reputable company but what is the risk the more companies you show what you have too the more chance of a problem most will ask you to take a share in the profit once the paperwork is signed make sure there is a time limit on the development and marketing a timeline and a settlement agreed on in advance a few hundred thousand dollars paid by the company if the time frame is not met if they leave your patent on the shelf what can you do if there is nothing in the contract as this happens so often too the promise of a market share then they just sit on your technology

step start by inhaling through your mouth until your lungs are almost filled to capacity not straining but full you don t need to necessarily do it fast or slow i usually use a medium speed slightly faster than normal if your hiccups are occuring very frequently it may be better to do this part as fast as possible so you are not interrupted by too many hiccups do not let any air out step swallow you are not really swallowing anything but it seems that without this act it doesn t work do not let any air out step now inhale some more you don t need to inhale a lot but do get some more air in it will start to get difficult to do this as you go but keep trying you obviously can t suck in as much air as you did initially but just a little will do do not let any air out step swallow again this too will start to get difficult as you go do not let any air out step repeat steps and until you cannot swallow again while it seems you can almost always suck in just a little more air it is the swallowing that gets to be impossible when you feel like you cannot swallow again swallow again anyway it will be hard to do your face will probably turn red and you may make squeaking sounds but you can swallow one last time by this time your lungs should also be quite full and it should be difficult to get much more air in as well while you should try not to let any air out if you have really repeated steps and as many times as you can you probably will end up letting a little out before you can take that last swallow if you find that air keeps escaping out of your nose even early in the process try squeezing it shut with your fingers step exhale

in the catholic church we use the historical critical method that means that we try use archaeology and biblical scholarship to figure out what the original authors intended rather than only asking how the words apply today for example in the book of the prophet jeremiah god says i knew you before you were born today right to life groups always quote that to prove that god is against abortion but using the historical critical method we can see that god made that statement to show something about god s relationship to us not our relationship to one another i m not pro choice myself but neither would i misuse the scriptures to support my beliefs this also helps explain why there are apparent contradictions in the texts such as the lineages of jesus the two creation accounts etc some other religions use more literal readings while others adopt one individual s interpretation of the bible as normative as is the case with jehovah s witnesses

keeping in mind that human beings are all unique individuals and so therefore so are the relationships that we form there some basic facts about domestic violence supported by research that allow us some insight and understanding of this complex issue the most predominant factor pertaining to the attitudes about and participation in domestic violence is that the impact of witnessing domestic violence whether by sight or by hearing on a child in the home is so great that it is the single most reliable predictor of whether or not the child will grow up to be a batterer there are a multiplicity of reasons for this we know that the male child learns to control and dominate from witnessing the violence against women rather than to respect the female as individual worthy of care and possessing value this is his pattern in other words this is the way that he sees to get what he wants this is how he learns to relate to women this is where he forms his opinions of what women are worth and of how they should or should not be treated keep in mind that in a majority of domestic violence relationships the anger displayed is not truly out of control rage that is misdirected or mishandled but rather the explosive anger and subsequent violence is a tool to intimidate and control the woman the lessons of how to use this tool are displayed on a regular basis in many homes across this country by the same token girls who grow up witnessing violence learn the lesson that violence is acceptable maybe even to be expected in relationships they do not have a healthy relationship model to follow and though they may hate the violence and though they may fear the batterer as adults the impact to the forming of healthy expectations and a healthy self image often means that as adults they too will find themselves in an abusive relationship sadly recent studies show that more and more frequently teenagers are experiencing violence and abuse in their relationships the child may not even have to reach adulthood before becoming a victim or victimizer many women who have never known what real love and caring and nurturing really is settle for the abuse that is familiar and the violence that they have come to expect in the book the gift of fear the author tells how circus elephants are trained to stay tied to a post that supports a main tent when they could obviously bring the whole thing down quite easily the elephants are first tied to the post with heavy metal chains sometimes set in concrete which are impossible for the elephant to move at first the elephant will strain and struggle but will eventually acquiese and concede failure from that time on the elephant can be restrained by a simple rope though he could easily break those ties he has learned from previous experience that struggling is useless and so he believes resisting is futile without sounding trite and as a woman who grew up watching her mother be violently abused for over years i can say that this concept is very much a relative example of what happens to a child that witnesses violence while growing up later in life the option that relationships could exist outside of control domination abuse and violence in many cases just do not seem possible and struggling to find a way out may indeed be viewed as futile they may fully recognize that the behavior is hurtful they may admit that it is destructive they may even concede that it is possible for other women to have healthy relationships but do not feel that those types of relationships will happen for them by the way many child survivors of domestic violence such as myself who have gone on to have healthy and loving relationships inspite of their background credit involvement of other adults in thier lives who offered positive examples of respect and caring and who allowed the child to see him or herself in a positive light getting involved in t
my answer is based open a single employee owner operator working a forty hour week do not change this scenario at this stage you need to remove all of your emotions from this business the banker investor only wants facts what would a fully established corporation pay you as an employee for this service convert salary to hourly to help simplify this i will use an hour understand that service is a product and product has a true cost leave any material parts or supplies off for know what does a twenty dollar an hour employee cost to operate a twenty dollar an hour employee actually cost the company much more now the required additional cost the fica tax that is removed from an employee s pay check is only half of the required tax the company pays the other half has to be matched by the company add the required workers comp insurance for this service the rates will vary based upon the risk rating of this category of employee new business usually pay additional because there is not an established annual loss ratio add general liability insurance these rate are based upon the risk rating of this category of employee new business usually pay additional because there is not an established annual loss ratio add two weeks paid vacation then divide by the total hours in a work year this is not exact because you still have to add workers comp general liability and half fica hr weeks hrs hrs x per hour divide by annual hrs that adds approx per hour add allowed paid sick days per year then use the above vacation formula the employee above is costing you forty hours a week but can only produce that is billable why federal law requires an employer give each employee minute paid breaks in an hour day drive time to and from the job or service location there are additional adds based upon your service we are now at between and per hour then add additional material parts or supplies you are responsible for them once they are installed now they become risk so you have to add mark up dou you have to pick them up there goes additional production time loss the above can be separated between job cost and overhead if you work of the hour work week at mr jones customer location this should be applied to an accounting created file or job for mr jones this is not overhead the additional hours will go to overhead if this were reversed hrs goes to overhead hrs to job cost overhead is a killer now we need to add more overhead do you need phones paper lights marketing interest on a start up loan someone to do your day to day accounting remember this is based upon a single owner operator company so you outsource this overhead do it yourself then you have to modify everything above because somewhere in your forty hour week you have change your hourly rate workers comp rate and general liability rate to meet there going rate and cost i would recommend out source at first you are usually a bigger asset to the company doing what you know now it is time to remove you as the employee and you back in as the owner this is why you started this the owner has to be paid why go through all the above if you could make the same pay with th of the stress working for someone else if you have a bank investor he wants to see you take reduced pay until you show a move from the red to the black he will see the reduced pay as you taking on some of the risk if you take pay it will alarm him he knows and understands everything involved above this will give him the impression that you are not confident in your plan then what is the most important thing of all is profit everything above is job cost or overhead profit is what this is about if you have a great business and a great product
get a tube of super glue empty it into a dish or someother type of flat non spill surface place the liquid on your dash leave it there over night the gasoline fumes will adhere to the off gas of the glue but when someone sits on the seat the fumes may come out again do not breath the glue or it will damage your lungs roll down all the windows and let it air out before you get in remove the glue and throw away other than that light a match and buy a new car or go to the local pick and pull and get a new rear seat

forex trading tips part why do hundreds of thousands online traders and investors trade the forex market every day and how do they make money doing it this two part report clearly and simply details essential tips on how to avoid typical pitfalls and start making more money in your forex trading trade pairs not currencies like any relationship you have to know both sides success or failure in forex trading depends upon being right about both currencies and how they impact one another not just one knowledge is power when starting out trading forex online it is essential that you understand the basics of this market if you want to make the most of your investments the main forex influencer is global news and events for example say an ecb statement is released on european interest rates which typically will cause a flurry of activity most newcomers react violently to news like this and close their positions and subsequently miss out on some of the best trading opportunities by waiting until the market calms down the potential in the forex market is in the volatility not in its tranquility unambitious trading many new traders will place very tight orders in order to take very small profits this is not a sustainable approach because although you may be profitable in the short run if you are lucky you risk losing in the longer term as you have to recover the difference between the bid and the ask price before you can make any profit and this is much more difficult when you make small trades than when you make larger ones over cautious trading like the trader who tries to take small incremental profits all the time the trader who places tight stop losses with a retail forex broker is doomed as we stated above you have to give your position a fair chance to demonstrate its ability to produce if you don t place reasonable stop losses that allow your trade to do so you will always end up undercutting yourself and losing a small piece of your deposit with every trade independence if you are new to forex you will either decide to trade your own money or to have a broker trade it for you so far so good but your risk of losing increases exponentially if you either of these two things interfere with what your broker is doing on your behalf as his strategy might require a long gestation period seek advice from too many sources multiple input will only result in multiple losses take a position ride with it and then analyse the outcome by yourself for yourself tiny margins margin trading is one of the biggest advantages in trading forex as it allows you to trade amounts far larger than the total of your deposits however it can also be dangerous to novice traders as it can appeal to the greed factor that destroys many forex traders the best guideline is to increase your leverage in line with your experience and success no strategy the aim of making money is not a trading strategy a strategy is your map for how you plan to make money your strategy details the approach you are going to take which currencies you are going to trade and how you will manage your risk without a strategy you may become one of the of new traders that lose their money trading off peak hours professional fx traders option traders and hedge funds posses a huge advantage over small retail traders during off peak hours between cet and cet as they can hedge their positions and move them around when there is far small trade volume is going through meaning their risk is smaller the best advice for trading during off peak hours is simple don t the only way is up down when the market is on its way up the market is on its way up when the market is going down the market is going down that s it there are many systems which analyse past trends but none that can accurately predict the future but if

hi i am a teacher s assistant here are some very simple tips for doing good on exams first of all find out as much as you can about what the exam is going to cover that way you don t study things that won t be asked second start studying at least days before information stored in the memory this far ahead is retained better than information crammed the day before the test if you start even earlier you won t have to study the day before at all you can reward yourself with some time off although quizzing yourself that day and the day of the exam will also keep your mind fresh don t try to learn anything new the day of the exam it might mess up the stuff your memory has already stored third make shortcuts to help you remember lists and dates associate the first letter of the items in the list with other words to form a sentence for example the solar system my very energetic mother just sliced up nine pizzas mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune pluto fourth a tip few people use try to study in the room where you will be writing the exam the mind actually associates your surroundings with the material you are absorbing and can help you recall that info during the exam fifth make index cards with information and questions on them use them to quiz yourself or a friend from class carry the cards with you everywhere you go and study them when you can i hope these tips come in handy

the answer to this question depends on the market some markets are seller s markets if you are in one you will probably have to offer more than the asking price you may ask your agent to provide an mls list of homes that have recently sold in the specific area you are considering look at the days on market dom the asking price and the sale price if the days on market are low you are probably in more of a seller s market even so look at how close the asking and sale prices are take the sales in the last days for that area and find the average cost per square foot for the type of home you are considering and use that average as a guideline new construction cost per sq ft is usually higher than resale cost per sq ft but consider recent renovations and lot size always make the contract contingent upon a home inspection there are some markets that are so favorable to sellers that buyers will waive this i do not recommend doing that on a resale buy always ask the seller to give you at least a one year home warranty good luck

there are a number of ways to try to approach large retailers with your products there are directories with buyers names that you can purchase check out chainstoreage com it s one of the larger media companies that deals with the large store market and a good place to start learning more about your potential customers the problem is that it s very very difficult to get a buyer s attention by sending in a unsolicited sample or pitch particularly if you are just getting your company started a second option and probably your best bet is to attend a trade show in the specific category your product or products are in for example if you are selling a new baseball bat attend a sporting goods trade show good buyers go to trade shows not only to meet with current vendors but to find new ones as well search online for trade show directories or sporting goods trade shows obviously using your category instead of sporting goods if you decide to attend a trade show be aware that it is a signficant committment of time and money you have to have your ducks in a row before you go to exhibit you don t have to look like a huge company but you have to look good there are way too many components of having everything ready to sell to cover here but you need to have retail wholesale pricing promotions delivery dates shipping carton info upc codes etc all ready to go if you want a large retailer to even consider doing business with you it can be very helpful to send a mailer to buyers who you know will be at the show ahead of time just the fact that you re exhibiting at an industry event gives you instant credibility it doesn t guarantee they will see you but it gives you something to at least get in the door with in a phone call or letter you also want to try to find manufacturer s reps at the trade show or have them find you contact the trade show hosts and see if there are ways to get a list of reps attending do a mailing to them or contact them before the show reps can be a lifeline to getting your product in the door though some retailers don t want to work with them reps represent a number of lines and typically have a good relationship with the buyers in the categories they specialize in they can make or break you so it is worth interviewing a number of them before you sign on reps work on a percentage it varies by industry you don t have to pay them until a sale is made and paid for by your account so the only risk is getting locked up with a bad company that puts your product in limbo don t sign exclusive distribution agreements with one company or rep firm unless you have seen many proven results from them with similar products the vast majority of firms only have strong ties to certain retailers and are not worth anything outside those areas beware of distributors they will often tell you they want your product and then try to charge a fee for placement in their catalog the vast majority of new products will not sell in a distributor s catalog it s only when they become well known brands will they work in that environment even if you get your products in front of retailers there are still many many factors that determine whether you will be successful i could literally write a book on it so i m going to have to wrap up this answer but i will be glad to answer follow up questions if you have them

you cannot if you believe there are incorrect items on your credit report then you have two potential choices the first is to dispute the items on your credit report it should take about days for everything including the postal service to make the necessary round trip in about that amount of time the second is sometimes available primarily to mortgages only you can request the lender directly contact the creditor who is erroneously reporting something there are special proceedures if the other party will document that it is an error to have it temporarily removed from that one institution s credit report usually to correct a fico score it is important to understand it must be an error and the other party must be willing to go to extra lengths to fix it as a favor to you the fix is only temporary and you will still need to dispute the item on your credit report the lender has to be willing to accept third party documentation and the party with the error has to be willing to go out of their way to write a letter explaining what really occured since i believe this costs the lender money to get a one time correction they have to really want you as a customer if it is not an error you will certainly get a denial this denial will show up on your credit report as a loan applied for but with no record of it being granted i have never heard of anyone doing it except for mortgages

racism is generally taught children are taught to hate people by their parents or their peers however some people decide to hate an entire race because of the actions of a few this is due to ignorance my younger brother was murdered by black men i never considered hating all black people but i do hate the that committed the crime against my brother what many people don t seem to understand is that racism is not just a white thing racism is a multi edged sword and it cuts all ways there is racism in every race unfortunately racism will never die as long as ignorance and intolerance lives inside even one person

several criteria determine the amount of traffic your website gets but by far the most important are to have a good search engine ranking and good links to your site search engines use a complicated and secret algorithm to determine which sites are placed where in the rankings but there are several tricks you can employ to boost you ranking there s lots of articles on the net to do with search engine optimization seo but i ignore all of them and do things my way this seems to work as every site i ve created ranks within the top on google even when there s millions of results found a site i created less than a week ago is already ranked number by yahoo and google these are some of my tips give your page a good title tag one of the first things a search engine looks at is the title tag of the page when writing the tag use the same words people are likely to key in when using a search engine for example if your page is about space travel then a title such as space travel be a shuttle rocket tourist and journey to the moon is much better than all about flying to the moon and back why because the first tag includes words people are likely to use in a search engine such as space travel shuttle rocket tourist journey and moon give your page a relevant name search engines look at page names if your domain was mydomain com then a page name such as mydomain com space travel will do much better than mydomain com section part page use the description tag some search engines including google support this tag others don t compare a yahoo search for black eyed peas to a google search both of them find blackeyedpeas com but yahoo describe it as multi platinum time grammy winners the black eyed peas cross an historic threshold as their hit the black eyed peas sergio mendes john legend justin timberlake and others google uses the description tag and describes it as official site includes videos message boards tour dates and photo gallery additional content is available to members use the alt tag some search engines ignore the alt tag others include it when spidering your site not only that but some visually impaired users and power surfers who turn off images rely on alt tags flash animation scripting dhtml spiders are unable to follow these linking systems if all your pages are linked using flash dhtml or scripts then the spider won t follow the links and your pages won t get indexed if you re designing your site this way the least you can do it to include conventional text links to the main pages of your site and ideally to a site map that contains text links to every page splash pages these are the animated front pages to a site usually nothing there other than an animation and a skip intro link spiders don t like splash and as this is the doorway to your site think carefully before creating one doorway pages these are pages that exist on a site but are not accessible to the visitor if someone tries to access the page they are redirected elsewhere historically webmasters created such pages and stuffed them full of popular keywords and phrases spiders have wised up to doorways and there s nothing better for getting yourself pushed right down in the rankings or kicked out altogether than use of doorway pages hidden text some web pages hide text by printing white text on a white background for example often such text has nothing at all to do with the site but is just a list of popular words and phrases used to draw people to the site spiders can spot tricks like these and will penalise sites that employ such tactics put a heading on your page the heading should closely match the page title you need to format the heading as a heading style a

aircraft are able to climb and maintain altitude by utilizing a combination of the bernoulli effect and simple momentum transfer in the air flow to generate lift lift is generated primarily by the wing of the aircraft to generate lift using the bernoulli effect the cross section of the wing is shaped in such a way that the distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge is greater along a path that runs over the wing than under the wing as the aircraft is propelled forward air necessarily flows both over and under the wing because of the greater distance that air must travel over the wing the air pressure over the wing is less than the air pressure under the wing this difference in pressure between the top and bottom of the wing results in a net upward force or lift on the wing this is the bernoulli effect one way of understanding the physical basis of the bernoulli effect is to consider that since the path of the air flow over the wing is longer the air over the wing is forced to expand into a greater volume than that flowing under the wing consequently the air pressure over the wing is necessarily lower than that under the wing lift can also be generated by dynamic momentum transfer from the airstream in this method the tilt or angle of attack of the wing relative to the overall direction of motion causes the flow of air striking the under surface of the wing to be turned or deflected downward that is a downward momentum is imparted to the airflow by the deflection induced by the wing newton s law dictates that a compensating reaction force lift acts in the upward direction on the wing according to f dp dt where p is the momentum f and p are vectors this is the same principle that generates sufficient upward force on water skis to keep a skier from sinking below the surface in practice the aerodynamics of flight are complicated by many other effects obviously opposing the upward lift is the downward force of gravity likewise opposing the forward thrust of the aircraft is the backward force of drag created by resistance to passage through the air also both the bernoulli and momentum transfer effects depend upon the smooth or laminar streamline flow of air around the wing various factors can induce turbulence in the air flow that generally spoils lift increases drag and decreases the overall efficiency of the aircraft in flight for more details see the web site http www aviation history com theory index theory html

i am sure you know exactly what you are trying to say but the rest of us need clarification do you mean your water heater is not heating water to a desired temperature and you would like to increase the temperature setting do you mean that you have a volt water heater and you would like to wire it with volts these two questions are entirely different subject matter the first one is easy enough you simply find the dial that sets the temperature and increase the setting for hotter water this mechanism will not heat the water to degrees if you were to heat it to such a temperature it would boil the water inside causing the unit to explode possibly with extreme injury to anyone near it at the time i believe the maximum temperature allowed is degrees for safety reasons also if you set it too high you will cause a deficiency in power gas usage it will be mre expensive to run the second question deals with the actual wiring of an electric water heater and how it gets power some water heaters are volt units these are generally smaller units and do not require volts under normal circumstances larger units can require volts to operate and in many cases are economical to operate versus a volt unit if you have a volt unit and only have a volt source to supply it with you must add a volt breaker and run new conduit wire to it there are ways to work around this if you do not have a slot available in the service panel but they are not recommended for safety reasons spend a time with a qualified electrician many will give free estimates advice on your best available optoins this is an area you should treat appropriately as misinformation could cause injury and possibly death i hope this helps you

i know what u thinking bro and i have the same mind and feeling with you nowadays almost everybody wants money due to many reasons even tho themselves dont want money but they want to earn them for someone else as you know and i think you already know that this is a harsh world ever than before those nice people you would imagine are long gone so dont count on people treating you nice anymore nowadays people would only be selfish and think themselves cheating lying all you can imagine of course the most important thing is being happy but if you are not happy and lost your happiness that you should have gotten then still live on and sacrifice yourself for somebody that you very care about and love of worthiness before you die so that way you wont feel any regret we all know that time wont go back what you missed is what you missed you cant change past and you cant get revenge or do anything about it but you can do and is the only way you can do is to change your future i know it s very hard because i have experienced this type of situation and i know how miserable it is and i know you want revenge but only do it legally if you are smart enough and later i have really understand the meaning of why someone says it will hunt back at you or someone holds grudge that is because you cant forget your past no matter how hard you try however if you have experienced only the minimum harshness then you might forget depending on your willingness but since like me if you have experienced too much harshness you will never pardon yourself but the bottom line is you only have one life and no matter how harsh it was you still have to get over it and do the best you can to sacrifice yourself for someone that you really cared and loved and want to sacrifice for them before you die so that way all those people who have really cared about you and loved you you would owe them back money cant buy you happiness but at least it will achieve your goal there are no easy way to make money trust me once i wished i could alot of money too but thats not gonna happen except you only go to school and get good education and then get a good job and earn your money however if you have some talent maybe you can make a fortune but most of us dont and we cant win the lottery either we are just not lucky enough so going to school and work is the only choice hope you can wake up and live like a new person and stop thinking about the past regrets

i am absolutely against the death penalty in all cases no matter what the offender did who the victim is and so on we punish murder because we think as societies that murdering is wrong so we cannot simply kill a person just because this person has killed that is plain revenge not justice it is doing to them what we re criticising them for doing remember this do as i tell not as i do leave alone killing other criminals who aren t killers themselves in that case we re doing to the offender something much worse than what they did in the first place and what about people who are innocent what about the political use of the death penalty what about the fact that most of the victims are black or latinos poor and powerless don t anglo saxon wealthy and powerful people commit crimes and even if they didn t which is not true doesn t anybody wonder what makes poor people commit crimes in the first place as long as the death penalty is legal anywhere in the world we re no better than animals at least they only kill when they re hungry humans make the state kill on our behalf only because we are a very cowardly species

if you dont want to pay for the services such as bank of america here are a couple of things you can do to reduce your chances of your identity being stolen shred all your mail by law you can request copy of your credit history every year from each of the three credit history companies at www annualcreditreport com i suggest you stagger your requests to each of them i e request experian first then months later request another report from transunion and another months later from equifax this way you get a free report every months dispute anything that is wrong most common credit cards forget to tell the credit history guys that you closed your account or paid all your loans in full when online try to use virtual credit numbers to make the purchases this facility is available for citicard customers and maybe amex the virtual numbers are good only for use and useless after that so if someone steals that it is useless when buying something offline save your receipts and make sure your statement is accurate a favourite scam is to charge maybe cents on a statement that way you dont notice it but a scammer who charges card owners cents a month can make a month no sweat and you dont even realize it also dont forget to shread any credit card solicitations you dont plan to use

i assume you wish to know how can you be saved if you are gay god accepts gays and lesbians he accepts all sinners if they turn away from their sins and ask for forgiveness a gay is a person who has chosen a path of sin a lesbian is a person who has chosen a path of sin a murderer can come into the kingdom of god if he repents and asks for forgiveness and accepts jesus christ as their personal savior and sins no more if the person who has chosen a path of sins turns fro that path and decided on another path without sin and does the rest then they can also enter the kingdom of heaven god does not hate the sinners he hates the sin comitting a homsexual act is in god s eyes an abomination a person is not born a murderer a person is not born a homosexual a person becomes a murderer when they commit a murderous act they chose to comit the sinful act a person becomes a homosexual when they commit a homosexual act the chose to commit the sinful act a person can be born with homcidal tendancies but they are not a murderer unless they are weak and they act on them a person can be born with homosexual tendancies but they are not a homosexual unless they are weak and they act on them god can give you stength to not act on these sinful temptations and yes it is ok to be attracted to animals a person can be attracted to animals and enter into gods kindom unless they act on these attractions they have not sinned beastiality is an action not a way of life it is a sin we don t here anymore about not giving in to the devil s temptations why not don t give in to temptation and you will not sin it is the choice of disobedience which is what you get punished for if you believed in god and have chosen to be obedient to god then you will not choose to give into temptation then you will not sin the next time you look at a person of the opposite sex lustfully understand that you have a choice not to act on those feelings yes i am sure many people have entered into the priesthood because they chose to be celibate they decided having no sex at all was better than risking eternal damnation because they gave into temptation and had homosexual sex remember a person is not a homosexual until they commit the sin so it is ok for a priest to be a priest as long as he does not act on his homosexual tendancies we have read that many have given in and that is why the church is geting sued about so many alter boy situations your sins will be forgiven go and sin no more

well you have some problems right from the get go first most places that employ more then or more people have a guide line and thats what they use to be fair not really fair its a way so they dont have to deal with the problems or a raise nd in your area it might be an hour but you know that and you still work there rd since onwership has changed if it has been within the last few yrs well then they aint lookin to give money out they are looking in to how to save money and make more money for themselves but with all this you do have some choices you can find another job or when talking to your new manager ask him her in a nice way i was wondering how the new ownership works will the job titles we have be the same if so is there a way to move up the ladder and how long have you been there if it has been years and you used to get a raise every year tehn kindly ask them if it is going to be the same and if not then what are the new changes going to be but remember some owners think strangly like i just got this place and the first thing they want to do is make me give them a raise and then your a problem i guess it all depends on how they act towards you whenever you want something in life just dont go out and say i want a raise you need to get a feel for how the people are and what they are doing with others you can also try and i know this sounds funny but say something like i have been here for yrs now and i wanted to know about my raise i know you wanted to pay me a hour but for right now will do make them laugh and smile its a ice breaker i know nurses are short but this does not mean you should be getting paid more cause you do more work im not saying this in a mean way life is priceless and you should get paid for your skills but owners look at it this way you get paid for what you do some days might be bad and some good if they said ok i will give you a raise to a hour but when the days are slow and you are not really doing anything then you will only make a hour you would be like he no dont go in and make it sound like give me a raise or else you might end up with something like no job at all but with all this info be nice and ask nice dont beat around the bush its a fair question to ask for a raise or maybe ask when do you see the company giving me a raise this is not right but my gf got a raise it was funny how she did it though she told he boss she was going to school for some night classes and she was getting grants and of the questions was do you plan on getting a raise in the next year so she went to work and told her boss she was going to school and getting grants and what the question was and he told her yes you will be and she got her raise and then some this is a little white lie but its like asking but not really asking for a raise

depending on our situation meeting people to become friends with can be very easy or extremely difficult clubs local organizations activities schools church libraries book stores gyms jogging parks beach lakes malls etc can all be places to meet new people once you ve met them talking and keeping the person interested is probably the most important thing to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask simple friendly questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc become genuinely interested in the other person there are lots of ways to start a conversation keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice for other topics to talk about you can search the internet about things that you or the people you will be talking with are interested in if you like games perhaps search for the latest information about the x box games pc games ps revolution etc if you like tv shows movies books pets etc a few jokes from time to time can also be a great ice breaker also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written

there are predictable contents of a standard business plan for example a business plan normally starts with an executive summary which should be concise and interesting people almost always expect to see sections covering the company the market the product the management team strategy implementation and financial analysis if you have the main components the order doesn t matter that much but here s the order i suggest executive summary write this last it s just a page or two of highlights company description legal establishment history start up plans etc product or service describe what you re selling focus on customer benefits market analysis you need to know your market customer needs where they are how to reach them etc strategy and implementation be specific include management responsibilities with dates and budgets make sure you can track results web plan summary for e commerce include discussion of website development costs operations sales and marketing strategies management team describe the organization and the key management team members financial analysis make sure to include at the very least your projected profit and loss and cash flow tables i don t recommend developing the plan in the same order you present it as a finished document for example although the executive summary obviously comes as the first section of a business plan i recommend writing it after everything else is done it will appear first but you write it last there are also some business tables and charts that are normally expected in a standard business plan cash flow is the single most important numerical analysis in a plan and should never be missing most plans will also have sales forecast and profit and loss statements i believe they should also have separate personnel listings projected balance sheet projected business ratios and market analysis tables i also believe that every plan should include bar charts and pie charts to illustrate the numbers i also recommend contacting your local sbdc and or score office these two organizations are funded by the sba and provide free business planning advice you can find your local score here http www score org your local sbdc can be found here http www bplans com sb if you re interested here s an expanded plan outline executive summary objectives mission keys to success company summary company ownership company history for ongoing companies or start up plan for new companies company locations and facilities products and services product and service description competitive comparison sales literature sourcing and fulfillment technology future products and services market analysis summary market segmentation target market segment strategy market needs market trends market growth industry analysis industry participants distribution patterns competition and buying patterns main competitors strategy and implementation summary strategy pyramids value proposition competitive edge marketing strategy positioning statements pricing strategy promotion strategy distribution patterns marketing programs sales strategy sales forecast sales programs strategic alliances milestones web plan summary website marketing strategy development requirements management summary organizational structure management team management team gaps personnel plan financial plan important assumptions key financial indicators break even analysis projected profit and loss projected cash flow projected balance sheet
i start off by setting an objective of the call that will move the sale forward i then list what questions i would like answers to focusing on problems or issues that my client may be dealing with that my product or service can help resolve under each problem question i list what i think the implications of these problems are within the client and try to get the client to put a dollar value on them if the value of the problem is greater than my product or service costs i now know that i have a prospect i attempt to move the client to ask if i can help resolve their issues i do not talk product or service until i know that the client is seeking a solution and has stated that they either must resolve it or are willing to take some action to resolve it planning a sales call is as important as the call itself without planning for an objective of a call you will never know if your call was successful or not a successful call is measured by agreement that the client has asked for a next step or agreed to a next step that you might propose good luck in planning your calls
since your looking for a financial partner i a assuming that you have no money that you can contribute to the financing of the investments most hard money lenders will not fund on property where the ltv or cltv will be more than of the value if it is a cltv then the second would have to be subordinated because i do not know any hard money lenders that will sit in second position on a property your best bet is to either acquire a personal loan from a lending institution or see about private funding if you have a good business packet that you can present to equity fund groups or even vc groups you might be ale to perk their interest those types of financing usually comes in the millions i just closed on a vc deal in tx worth m the original deal asked for m but the vc group was not interested in that low investment value so you need to make sure that the people that your targeting is with in your play group for now hope this helps if you have any other questions feel free to contact me directly good luck

here are some key tips to the best way to soundproof walls an entire field of specialty contractors focuses on soundproofing rooms to serve as recording practice studios or home theaters or simply to cut noise from something like a nearby freeway consulting an expert will provide the most thorough sound control program look in the yellow pages under acoustical consultants at a more basic level you can do several things to cut sound transmission without resorting to the garage band tricks of nailing old mattresses to the walls and stuffing window openings with sheets of rigid foam insulation if you re building new rooms from scratch use construction techniques that dramatically cut sound transmission an extra sheet of drywall on interior walls for example reduces noise but the best trick involves making the wall thicker by framing it so each stud touches the drywall on only one side of the wall this makes it difficult for sound waves to vibrate their way through the wall you ll find useful diagrams of this setup at the soundproofing web site for existing rooms one of the best sound fixes is a new door for example doorcraft says its procore solid core doors are percent quieter than hollow core doors and quieter than solid wood doors too a couple of other quick solutions install mats made of soundproofing foam and seal openings such as outlet boxes to cut sound transmission

yahoo geocities http geocities yahoo com your web address would be like geocities com your yahoo id which is not too professional in my opinion geocities is good for personal websites but for an international conference that is too cheap it doesnt give your conference the credibility it deserves godaddy com https www godaddy com gdshop hosting shared asp se b ci has a hosting plan of only per month which i think is extremely affordable you can buy a domain name for the conference for with godaddy so that you can have a professional looking web name www yourinternationalconference com and having this type of url alone is an effective marketing and branding tool for your business i suggest you go pay the minimum hosting fee instead of going to a website free of cost if you are attracting international visitors using a free website such as geocities puts a huge question mark on your conference s credibility

in think you need to know who you are find a profession that will help the type of person you are grow choose a profession within the above criteria that will most likely provide the greatest overall financial reward there are many personality tests that will help you determine what kind of person you are like myers briggs there are also tests that will give you feedback on particular professions that you might be best suited for this is probably a good start to finding out about yourself and what you might be best doing after working for ten years and finishing two masters degrees from top universities i m just figuring out what i want to do with my life and it most likely will require going back to school again my best suggestion to a young person is not to spend so much time searching for what you love to do i think this is the wrong message many young people hear do what you love and the money will come is what i heard years ago look at what you re good at and find a profession that utilizes those skills to make you the most money particularly in the long run for example if you re a very attractive young female don t go run out and become an exotic dancer because you ll make a night as it will not last long or if you re very good at sports don t bet on multi million dollar pro contract unless your tall and can kiss the rim of a bball hoop back it up with a good education the point is most young people i know live a much more complex life than generations before i think i was the first generation like this this makes for very complex people who are educated and know about many things work on the other hand is relative simple so just pick something you re good at and that will make you the most money by the time you re if you re good at it you will at least like it and you might make enough to be independently wealthy by the time you hit your forties final recommendations find the things you like to do not necessarily what you love to do pick a profession that utilizes those skills and will make you the most money work hard and make money when you re in your s and have a few hundred grand in the bank you can take a look around and maybe move on to other things but until then keep you head down and follow an accepted career path
take your experiences and list them make headings like customer service telephone retail sales cleaning stock room experience then you need to determine what it was about each type of job you enjoyed was it the customers you liked disliked did you like the behind the scenes work or the in your face jobs better now before you go to fast if you could get paid to do anything you wanted to do what would it be finally put it all together and see what skills you have listed and how they can develop into experiences such as you like to work with your hands and want to make things to sell so take a look at your jobs and find out if you have any exp selling master the art of selling and convince somone why they need what you make if you are no good at selling you could always sell on ebay it really isn t too hard just be creative and don t worry about it hope this helps and good luck

talking is probably the largest factor i can think of to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc becoming genuinely interested in the other person a somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn t like generally the other person will complain too and you ll have you re conversation you have to be very careful not to do this often because you don t want the other person to think you re a whiner there are lots of other ways to start a conversation as well and college is a great place for it keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice ask simple friendly questions about the person also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written fission
saving is not about big numbers it isn t even about little numbers across a long time it is about consistent numbers across any time saving money certainly involves not buying stuff but this view is far too narrow so long as saving is equated with sacrifice it will be an uphill battle to save having day to day life that is as stress free as possible is very important continual sacrifice and stress free living clash harshly for many people some people focus on changing lifestyle related choices sometimes called the latte factor as a method for realizing day to day savings i agree that this is good advice for some people but as a first step it isn t necessarily the most effective there are other things that can be done too reduce monthly fees stop paying banking fees for services you don t use or don t need many banks charge monthly service fees or maintenance fees for checking accounts if your bank offers free checking or free checking with direct deposit and you have direct deposit switch your account or find a bank that does offer free checking even the smallest leak in any plumbing system will eventually collect enough water to fill a bathtub so to will even the smallest recurring monthly service fee eventually steal one month s rent detemine a reasonable monthly budget it is important to know where it all goes rent utilities cell phone car payment insurance groceries there is no doubt these numbers exist but most importantly nearly all of them can be known in advance some of them can t be known exactly but they can be estimated my advice is to estimate unknown amounts not for the sake of accuracy the cell phone bill is usually per month but for the sake of certainty the cell phone bill has never been more than in any month in the beginning of making and using budgets budgets work best when costs are overestimated rather than underestimated it is far less uncomfortable to have too much money left at the end of the month than it is to have too little left over and bills still to be paid at the end of the month begin saving automatically if your employer offers direct deposit and you can open a free checking account with or without direct deposit use this financial automation to the maximum open a second checking account then contact your hr department to request that your paychecks be split across your two checking accounts separate paying bills from saving and investing use your primary account for all monthly expenses rent utilities food car payments and pet food this is your cash account the second checking account is dedicated for saving and investment purposes you won t draw funds from this investment account to pay bills that isn t what saving is about saving is about having money available to fund medium term and long term goals things like retirement paying college tuition or buying a home the investment account will drive all of your automatic saving and investment mechanisms similar to direct deposit automatic withdrawals can be scheduled to transfer funds from your investment account here is how to implement the above steps look at the ing direct website ing has savings accounts with excellent interest rates without no minimum required balance in addition look at the vanguard website if you don t have an ira k or any other kind of retirement account vanguard has the lowest custodial costs per year and lowest minimum required balances usually of any financial services company today accumulating enough money to open an account with vanguard may take some time but getting started saving with ing direct is something that can occur bef

best way is to business process reengineering look at the work flows and tasks performed by the department is there a need for desks and cubicles to be changed is the environment consistent with the overall culture of the organisation etc in terms of staff work flows you can use simple excel to determine process flows and determine whether there are too many loops which reduces productivity or whether there are any gaps in authorisation now don t do this for all the activities just do it for regular or critical activities example if you are working for the leasing department of a company you ll check first whether information gathering from the client is streamlined there is no point asking the client at three different stages information when you could have asked him one time plus there is also the case of asking optimum levels of information since a glut of info will just swamp your staff and constrain you record keeping capabilities unnecessarily so build a process guideline so that everyone understands what is standard acceptable behaviour once you have systems in place develop intrapreneurship by inculcating the spirit of rewarding staff who bring in new ideas that help improve the company s work the easitest thing is to link performance driven assesments to a regular review of the departments work so there is always focus on these areas balance score card method also helps a lot especially determining thekey drivers driving your department well i have typed a lot of stuff hope this helps you best regards

i know you really care about your friend and that is very good i am afraid in this case you probably should advise her as well as possible about std s and the like in fact rather than talk to her parents i think you could educate her yourself take her to planned parenthood and let them really inform her about what she must do to be safe you can threaten to tell her parents if she doesn t a little leverage i think however that is the best compromise she has free will and must be allowed to both trust in you and make her own choices in life because you care it is your right to stack the deck in favor of safety by connecting her to sexually safe information from a place like planned parenthood who by the way is completely confidential she cannot say no so sneak her away for lunch and a session at pp make it a fun day call ahead and make an appointment in fact it may be wise for you to consult them about your situation they have dealt with this s of times and can probably add great information to what i have already told you good luck being a good friend is sometimes hard but a betrayal to her parents is something you will never get to change if she screws up herself it is not your responsibility sometimes people only learn when things go wrong sad but true be sure to follow up with what happens if you decide to consult them

to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask simple friendly questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc become genuinely interested in the other person there are lots of ways to start a conversation keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice for other topics to talk about you can search the internet about things that you or the people you will be talking with are interested in if you like games perhaps search for the latest information about the x box games pc games ps revolution etc if you like tv shows movies books pets etc a few jokes from time to time can also be a great ice breaker also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written i had one friend tell me recently that the way she dealt with being shy was to convince herself that talking was a competition with her own insecurities as the opponent thinking that way forced herself not to give in and became more confident with herself fission

contract for deed a contract for deed aka installment land contract is an agreement wherein the buyer makes installment payments on an arrangement similar to an automobile financing the seller holds legal title to the property as security for payment while the buyer has equitable title when the buyer pays the full amount due under the contract the seller delivers legal title to the buyer equitable title gives the buyer the right to live in the property improve it rent it and otherwise enjoy all of the benefits of ownership however since the buyer does not have legal title he cannot use it as collateral for a home equity loan although in some states banks will lend against an equitable interest in a contract for deed the irs generally treats a contract for deed as a sale which means the buyer has the tax benefits of ownership thus the payments of interest that are made by the buyer in possession are deductible as mortgage interest even though the buyer does not have legal title to the property a contract for deed seller must report the transaction as an installment sale on form irs form once sold the seller cannot claim depreciation or any other tax benefits of the property if the buyer defaults on the contract and the seller exercises his legal option to reclaim the property the tax code treats the transaction as a foreclosure the legal process for repossession of the property is not entirely clear in every state some state statutes e g il tx pa clearly spell out the process which is somewhat more involved than an eviction but clearly less burdensome than a full blown foreclosure in most states the process is not clearly defined so courts deal with a buyer s default on a case by case basis
i looked on the securities and exchange commission sec website http www sec gov and tried to search for the company but there were no results i went to forman mills website and there is no investor information section it says they have only stores so based on this they are a relatively small company and i am guessing that they are not publicly traded if that is the case they are not required to make public any of their financial information and will probably not disclose it to you even if you called and asked however it is a possibility that the company is owned by a larger publicly traded company however forman mills website does not indicate this if they are owned by a publicly traded company you would be able to find the k for that company but it would likely provide consolidated information and would not give you information about forman mills on a stand alone basis

if i understand your question not really sure that i do i am going to assume you mean we as in everyone or society we get money by believing that there is someone out there dumber then us we beleive that someone out there is going to be so stupid and take paper from us and give us something in return i mean think about it there are people out there that are willing to work for you and all you have to do is give them a piece of paper in return for their efforts they in turn will run out and give others pieces of paper in return for things they need round and round the wheels on the bus go sound strange not really if you think about it money has no real value the only value that money has is that we believe we can exchange it for things that we need of course for you business minds out there i will include that money is the following etymology middle english moneie from old french from latin mon ta mint coinage from mon ta epithet of juno temple of juno of rome where money was coined the definition of money has been defined as a medium of exchange a store of value and a unit of account as a medium of exchange money easily transfers for goods services or ideals money stores its value as long as the belief system that money can be exchanged for something else holds true in the future money gives us a way of accounting for items for example you can have of elephants in your closet and that would be a widely understood meaning because most people through out the world use money money must be portable divisible durable and stable money is exchanged transferred stored created and controlled by various financial institutions located through out the world the term m and m come into play here but this is getting too long for yahoo answers such financial institutions include commercial banks that take deposits of money and in turn use the profits to make loans for profit savings and loan associations s ls take deposits for the primary reason of making profit on loans from mortgages mutual savings banks turn all depositors into owners of the bank dividing profits from operations among the owners or deposit holders credit unions are restricted to members usually of organizations such as schools unions or associations the federal reserve system or simply the fed controls the money in the united states of america the fed sets monetary policy with the main goals being employment and inflation control in addition to these banks there are the world bank and the imf neither of these organizations are actually banks as we know of them in the traditional sense they are however agencies within the united nations the world bank provides a limited range of services mainly focused in financing international trade they provide money for schools power plants hospitals and infrastructure the img international monetary fund is composed of countries that work for the stability of exchange rates provide short term loans to member countries work for monetary cooperation among members and work out payments among member countries money is just money think that sums it up nicely

aren t credit reporting agencies fun to deal with my first thought is to verify if the judgement is actually yours or someone with the same name but in your city many times judgements are sent to the credit bureau without date of birth or social security numbers so they have to guess who s account it goes on i ve had it done to me a couple of times so send a letter to the credit bureau demanding that they investigate it and verify it is actually your judgement if you do have to investigate this yourself first see if you can find a nice helpfull court clerk yes there are a couple still around in this country who will look up the case and tell you if it was against you or not if it was against you then you have no choice but order a copy of the court records pay attention to the information about proof of service they can t just hold a trial without notifying you first the proof of service explains who served you and how you were served if the information isn t there or not accurate you have grounds to get the judgement reversed due to improper service anyway follow this advice contact me if you have any more questions

the answer is by using simple mathematics first you need to decide how much of each stock you are going to buy since not all stocks are priced equally some would be other and some cents over ten stocks decide what ratio you will hold of each stock e g so totalling the ratio is now you can use a combination of the ratios and fractions to find out how much stock you can hold with your i may have left you out on a limb there but this calculation is uneccessary why don t you just buy your stock one by one until you run out of money p ok lets try the example with stocks and k you want the weighting to be so you want ths of your money to go to stock ths of your money to go to stock k k now say stock zxc was each and stock abc was now you go stocks stocks there you go now do the similar calculation with your ten stocks haha good luck

steps to better credit correct blatant mistakes your credit score is only as good as what shows up in your credit report review your reports from all three credit bureaus for accuracy once a year as well as several months before applying for a loan changing a mistake on your report such as a payment that is wrongly labeled as late can take days to three months sometimes longer pay your bills on time this is always a good practice and it s especially critical that you make prompt payments close to the time you need a loan that s because a late or missed payment in the last few months is likely to lower your score much more than an isolated late payment five years ago reduce your credit card balances a heavily weighted factor in your fico score is how much money you owe on your credit cards relative to your total credit limit generally it s good to keep your balances at or below percent of your credit card limit said jeanne kelly founder of the kelly group in brookfield conn which helps clients improve their credit scores try cnn money s new debt reduction planner for help wiping out credit card balances pay off debt rather than moving it around since the ratio of your credit card balance to your credit limit is key closing out an account and transferring the balance simply means you increase that ratio which is likely to lower your score in other words say you owe a total of on four credit cards each of which has a limit your total credit limit is of which your total balance accounts for percent if you transfer all your balances to two cards and cancel the other two your total credit limit is reduced to and your balance now accounts for percent of that limit don t close unused credit card accounts near loan time if you have several credit card accounts but are only using a few of them you ll only raise your balance to limit ratio if you close the unused ones you also shouldn t open new accounts when applying for a loan if possible if you have a short credit history or very few accounts opening a new credit line may lower your score since you don t have a proven track record said jan davis an executive vice president at transunion what s more a new account will lower the average age of your accounts another factor in your fico score

bond funds can lose money because the prices of the bonds they hold go up or down every day like all investments the factor that most affects bond prices is market interest rates as interest rates rise as they have been doing in the u s for over a year bond prices fall and as the prices of bonds fall the value of shares of mutual fund that own the bonds falls too all mutual funds including bond funds have to assign values to all their investments at the end of every day and publish the net asset value nav for the fund reflecting those values if the prices of the bonds they hold go down they have to lower their published nav to account for that for open ended funds the nav is the price you get or pay when you sell or buy fund shares

for a long time the cause of tutankhamun s death was unknown and was the root of much speculation how old was the king when he died did he suffer from any physical abnormalities had he been murdered many of these questions were finally answered in early when the results of a set of ct scans on the mummy were released the body was originally inspected by howard carter s team in the early s though they were primarily interested in recovering the jewelry and amulets from the body to remove the objects from the body which in many cases were stuck fast by the hardened embalming resins used carter s team cut up the mummy into various pieces the arms and legs were detached the torso cut in half and the head was severed hot knives were used to remove it from the golden mask to which it was cemented by resin since the body was placed back in its sarcophagus in the mummy has subsequently been x rayed three times first in by a group from the university of liverpool then in by a group from the university of michigan and finally in a team of egyptian scientists led by dr zahi hawass secretary general of the egyptian supreme council of antiquities conducted a ct scan on the mummy early pre x rays of his mummy had revealed a dense spot at the lower back of the skull this had been interpreted as a chronic subdural hematoma which would have been caused by a blow such an injury could have been the result of an accident but it had also been suggested that the young pharaoh was murdered if this is the case there are a number of theories as to who was responsible one popular candidate was his immediate successor ay interestingly there are seemingly signs of calcification within the supposed injury which if true meant tutankhamun lived for a fairly extensive period of time on the order of several months after the injury was inflicted much confusion had been caused by a small loose sliver of bone within the upper cranial cavity which was discovered from the same x ray analysis some people have mistaken this visible bone fragment for the supposed head injury in fact since tutankhamun s brain was removed post mortem in the mummification process and considerable quantities of now hardened resin introduced into the skull on at least two separate occasions after that had the fragment resulted from a pre mortem injury it almost certainly would not still be loose in the cranial cavity it therefore almost certainly represented post mummification damage

well first there is an enourmous amount of data to interpret then there s the inter relationships between the data to correlate e g consumer price index producer price index to other inflationary indicators all of this analysis is likely done by scientists and there is some esoteric stuff as well then the policy advisor takes all this vast information from the scientist and considers economic policy there are two basic types of policies monetary and fiscal and usually they try to work in conjunction with one another overall the economy is comprised of c consumer spending g government spending i industry spending x m imports exports which is trade so economic policites would look at all of the above and set interest rates or determine whether to advise an increase in government spending or in some cases create trade tariffs but underlying all this policy is obviously intense political pressure

if you have a problem employee you have but two choices try to coach them to be better or get rid of them when you finally do fire them chances are you ll wonder what took you so long steps provide a job description the employee signs off on to prove they have had their exact duties explained to them discuss with employees any behavior that is immediate grounds for termination evaluate employee work at least once a year and document deficiencies in their performance versus your expectations or their actual job requirements know your employer s rules about firing someone as there may be specific steps you are required to take in order to actually fire someone even if they are not doing their job be sure to communicate their performance problems as soon as you are aware of them and coach them on how to improve have the employee sign some sort of document outlining the conversation in order to cover yourself it should specifically state that they do not necessarily agree but that they have been told they are not being effective in their job outline specific improvements changes required in order for them to keep their job and give them clear deadlines as to when these improvements changes must be seen by also be clear that the next stage is firing so they sign stating they have been told of the consequences of not changing during this conversation if they continue to underperform be sure to make them aware that they must improve if they want to continue in this job make a plan on how you will proceed without them think about their responsibilities and be ready to assign them to someone else call them into your office or a conference room be sure to choose somewhere private tell them the purpose of the meeting within seconds of them entering the room if you have done your job properly they will not be surprised and you will only torture them by drawing it out tips be sure you have followed your employer s required steps for firing someone document the course of events to prove you had at least one conversation with this person and have given them at least one opportunity to correct the problem before firing them this is the absolute minimum you are required to do but most employers go by a three strikes rule unless the offense is serious in nature question whether the entire problem is a bad employee or whether your management skills have something to do with their low performance it may be best to do it on a friday so they do not cause disruption during the week how you handle this termination will define how other employees think of you and their job if you are unfair or arbitrary they will think they could be next if you call security and make them surrender their keys and march out immediately if there is no legitimate threat to the business they will think you re a jerk remember other employees will have been friends with this person warnings you should consult a lawyer or understand employment law in your state to be sure you comply and are treating the employee fairly consider this employee may try to sue you for discrimination if you do not have adequate documentation such as employee signatures on job descriptions performance appraisals etc then your organization may lose any lawsuit filed by disgruntled employees

you want to check with the division of corporations within your state however another big concern is to also check existing trademarks with the unites states patent and trademark office uspto why you may ask even though a company and its name which are created by the laws of the respective state may not be in direct conflict with any other company of that state you may run into problems later with trademark issues of other companies from other states with similar names trademarks are usually registered with the uspto and they provide a search engine online at uspto gov it is worth checking to avert future lawsuits of trademark dilution or unsavory business practices with regard to trademark infringement of a company that you did not know had a similar name or logo albeit you should have known in terms of the law when such trademarks are federally registered remember companies are created by each state and your state will only check to see if that company name is registered in the state so be prudent and check the trademarks of other companies

good credit is like trust it can be lost in a flash but takes a long time to build if you have lost it you will need to buckle down for years and just be on time all the time and not rack up more debt in the place of the old over time your score will improve if you have screwed up your credit the only thing you really can do is get everything back on track every bill paid and stop being late then just keep on track for the rest of your life over the years your credit will recover and then start to become better and better the best thing for growing credit is time so keep all your oldest cards and pay them off but don t close them keep them open because they are a record of how long you have had your credit if you remain in good standing with a credit card company that you opened say when you were and then you have it till your you will have years worth of history with them that is a good thing even if you don t use it all the time just keep it open always good luck with it

body language a cat s posture tail ears eyes and hair all speak volumes but frequently because we fail to understand and interpret the signals correctly we blame the cat unjustly understanding the body language of felines can be difficult even counterintuitive since it is meant to convey messages primarily to other cats signs of fearfulness or irritation can be easily misread as playful excitement because a cat s associated behaviors appear to be similar and misinterpretation of cats often arises out of confusion with the body language of dogs which is sometimes opposite in meaning a cat s tail is its signal flag held high the tail is a banner communicating confidence curling around another feline s tail or a person s legs it offers friendly greeting in motion it usually indicates excitement the cat is either in predator mode having sighted a bird or a mouse or is feeling playful hiding behind a chair ready to pounce on a passing person or cat and while the rhythmic wagging of a dog s tail signals happiness the agitated whipping of your cat s tail means that he is perturbed or upset don t startle a cat in this state your reward may be a claw swipe or a bite cats are affectionate and love to be touched but only on their own terms they may greet members of their household fondly with cheek rubs but they prefer to initiate this contact cats may exchange quick eye blink hellos with each other but they seldom stare instead they will respond to a long stare from you by freezing movement and then alternately looking at you and looking away huddling with its tail wrapped around its body a cat may be telegraphing that it is cold a similar body position but with a relaxed cat signals its dreamy contentment a sick cat often doesn t curl up but lies in the position requiring the least energy an alert attentive cat scans wide eyed ears pricked and rotating tuned to threats prey and other felines spotting something of interest the cat stares intently pitching its ears and its whiskers forward

i know of legit work at home companies and i have personally worked for both of them my favorite workingsol com is a legitimate company that primarily does customer service and you would take incoming calls and get to set your own schedule the pay scale ranges from to an hour for projects and you pick your own hours you are guaranteed at least the minimum for every hour that you are working even if you get no calls in that hour if you have a busy hour though you can make the maximum and there are a few incentive based projects where you can make even more than the max it is not telemarketing most of the projects handle incoming calls i worked for them for several years during college and it was so covenient to be able to pick my own hours every week you get paid bi weekly by check the downside is that they get a lot of applications and i recall waiting close to a year before getting selected to start with them back in and they are much better known now then they were then you can apply online at their site apply as soon as possible the sooner you apply the sooner you can start in the meantime a company that you can start nearly right away with is live ops they also do customer service oriented projects but i can t recommend them very highly because they do not pay a minimum per hour instead they paid around cents per talk minute which sounds good but unfortunately you are generally only on the phone minutes per hour however liveops is still good if you are at the house doing housework or reading or surfing you can answer the odd call here and there and pick up some extra cash i hear that if you stick with them you can get more hours but i did not stick with them long enough to find out they do not charge you to work for them and you will not get ripped off they will send your check although their payments are monthly as i recall so it is a long wait you can apply at either companies website neither will ask you to pay for anything although both require that you have a phone line that you can use for work and high speed internet workingsol also pays you for your training time you ll find many more details on their websites good luck

hi i think you re off to a great start so far you d be surprised as to how many people don t ask themselves and each other those same questions before starting a partnership business what you have to do is take those questions and form a business plan that answers all of them and any more you come up with along the way a business plan will help you decide how you will split money costs responsibilities and so much more i often tell people who want to start their own business that a business plan is great to have but the best part is in creating one during that creation process you and your partners will forecast your needs and expectations which will act as a valuable guide down the line this way you have your plan in writing and there is less of a chance for a he said she said type of conflict typical of a business where everyone just jumped in without anyone knowing what belongs to who or who does what to answer your question more directly you and your friend decide how it all works you can go for example or you can go too it all depends on how much risk you want to both share or not share for that matter obviously if you put in of the money for everyday costs i would expect you d want of the profits however it doesn t always have to be that way you can put in for example of the startup costs but decide to split the profits another consideration is a buy out clause should one of you decide that you no longer want to be part of the business the other should have the option to buy out his or her partner it s all up to you and your partner just make sure to put it in writing in a contract formal or informal signed by all parties involved and a couple of witnesses include your full names the dates and your business plan this will not only help keep track of everyone s job descriptions but will protect you and your partner in the long run good luck and i wish you success

most banks and mortgage insurance companies require that foreclosed properties be listed with a realtor to obtain top dollar if i were you i would locate an agent that will email you properties as they become available from their mls just be specific as to what you are looking for as an investment no sense in sending listings that you would not entertain purchasing most foreclosures will state in their remarks such things as bank owned special addenda apply subject to third party approval hud fha case and or short sale another thing you can do is locate a title company that will send you for a minimal fee or deal directly with you on line county records office and access properties that have a notice of default recorded against the property www theforeclosures com website in my opinion is not as up to date as it needs to be and i wouldn t wast my money by purchasing a membership they are very good about advertising properties that are in default but do not remove them when they have been sold or go under contract realtors will almost always have the most current information realtor utah

in most cases you have to contact the homeowner and have them agree to sell you their home then you have to contact a real estate agent and have them put it on the market for market value the real estate agent has to contact the bank that holds the mortgage and try and negotiate a time frame to sell the home and get a contract on the home the homeowner will have to fill out paper work for the bank like a monthly spending expense and proof of income they just want to know why you went default once the bank has agreed to back off and give you some time then you write up an offer you can offer less than what the owner owes but not too much lower because the mortgage company sends out an appraiser to make sure they are not loosing by accepting your contract the agen has to mention that this is the best offer they have gotten you have to submit a pre qual letter from a mortgage company with the contract if the bank accepts your bid you will have days to close or they will continue with the foreclosure this process can take up to months for the bank to accept and another month for the clossing so that will earn the homeowner an extra months hope that helps

why people are afraid to buy from you many homeowners believe that to maximize their profit on a home sale they should sell it themselves at first glance they feel selling a home is simple and why should they pay a broker fees for something they could do themselves in fact close to of all the homes sold last year were sold for sale by owner fsbo however close to half of the fsbo s said that they would hire a professional next time they sold thirty percent said they were unhappy with the results they achieved by choosing fsbo why many fsbo s told us that the time paperwork and everyday responsibilities involved were not worth the amount of money they saved in commissions for others the financial savings were even more disappointing by the time they figured the amount of fees paid to outside consultants inspectors appraisers title lawyers escrow and loan officers marketing advertising they would have been better off having paid the broker s fee which would have included many of these charges up front selling a home requires an intimate understanding of the real estate market if the property is priced too high it will sit and develop a reputation for being a problem property if the property is priced too low you will cost yourself serious money some fsbo s discovered that the lost money as a result of poor decisions outweighed the commission before you decide to sell fsbo consider these questions and weigh the answers of assuming the responsibility versus employing a professional a little time spent investigating up front will pay off tenfold in the end questions to consider do i have the time energy know how and ability to devote a full forced effort to sell my home one of the keys to selling your home efficiently and profitably is complete accessibility many homes have sat on the market much longer than necessary because the owner was unwilling or unavailable to show the property realize that a certain amount of hours each day is necessary to sell your home am i prepared to deal with an onslaught of buyers who perceive fsbo s as targets for low balling one of the challenges of selling a home is screening unqualified prospects and dealing with lowballers it often goes unnoticed how much time effort and expertise it requires to spot these people quickly settling for a lowball bid is usually worse than paying broker commissions am i offering financing options to the buyer am i prepared to answer questions about financing one of the keys to selling whether it s a home a car anything is to have all the necessary information the prospective buyer needs and to offer them options think about the last time you purchased something of value did you make a decision before you had all your ducks in a row by offering financing options you give the home buyer the ability to work on their terms and open up the possibilities of selling your home quickly and more profitably a professional real estate agent will have a complete team from lenders to title reps for you to utilize they ll be at your disposal do i fully understand the legal ramifications and necessary steps required in selling a home many home sales have been lost due to incomplete paperwork lack of inspections or not meeting your states disclosure laws are you completely informed of all the steps necessary to sell real estate if not a professional would be a wise choice do i have the capability of handling the legal contracts agreements and any disputes with buyers before or after the offer is presented ask yourself if you are well versed in legalese and if you are prepared to handle disputes with buyers to avoid any disputes it is wise to put all negotiations and agreements in writing many home sales have been lost due to misinterpretation of what was negotiated have i contacted the necessary professionals title inspector home
ask yourself is the possibility of getting this girl worth the effort of overcoming your insecurities and shyness is holding her seeing her smile laugh waking up to see her face in the morning worth putting for effort to change you re the only one that can actually do that though here is a little advice that may help you in talking to her to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc become genuinely interested in the other person there are lots of ways to start a conversation keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice ask simple friendly questions about the person also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise as for the no being able to relate to others because you don t drink of dance you re not the only one a lot of people don t enjoy the bar and club scenes you ll find others that feel the same way if the people you want to hang out with do goto these places you can go with them everyonce in a while you really don t need experience to be with friends at most of them if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful tod

easter is an annual festival observed throughout the christian world the date for easter shifts every year within the gregorian calendar the gregorian calendar is the standard international calendar for civil use in addition it regulates the ceremonial cycle of the roman catholic and protestant churches the current gregorian ecclesiastical rules that determine the date of easter trace back to ce at the first council of nicaea convened by the roman emperor constantine at that time the roman world used the julian calendar put in place by julius caesar the council decided to keep easter on a sunday the same sunday throughout the world to fix incontrovertibly the date for easter and to make it determinable indefinitely in advance the council constructed special tables to compute the date these tables were revised in the following few centuries resulting eventually in the tables constructed by the th century abbot of scythia dionysis exiguus nonetheless different means of calculations continued in use throughout the christian world in gregory xiii pope of the roman catholic church completed a reconstruction of the julian calendar and produced new easter tables one major difference between the julian and gregorian calendar is the leap year rule see our faq on calendars for a description of the difference universal adoption of this gregorian calendar occurred slowly by the s though most of western europe had adopted the gregorian calendar the eastern christian churches still determine the easter dates using the older julian calendar method the usual statement that easter day is the first sunday after the full moon that occurs next after the vernal equinox is not a precise statement of the actual ecclesiastical rules the full moon involved is not the astronomical full moon but an ecclesiastical moon determined from tables that keeps more or less in step with the astronomical moon the ecclesiastical rules are easter falls on the first sunday following the first ecclesiastical full moon that occurs on or after the day of the vernal equinox this particular ecclesiastical full moon is the th day of a tabular lunation new moon and the vernal equinox is fixed as march resulting in that easter can never occur before march or later than april the gregorian dates for the ecclesiastical full moon come from the gregorian tables therefore the civil date of easter depends upon which tables gregorian or pre gregorian are used the western roman catholic and protestant christian churches use the gregorian tables many eastern orthodox christian churches use the older tables based on the julian calendar in a congress held in the eastern churches adopted a modified gregorian calendar and decided to set the date of easter according to the astronomical full moon for the meridian of jerusalem however a variety of practices remain among the eastern churches there are three major differences between the ecclesiastical system and the astronomical system the times of the ecclesiastical full moons are not necessarily identical to the times of astronomical full moons the ecclesiastical tables did not account for the full complexity of the lunar motion the vernal equinox has a precise astronomical definition determined by the actual apparent motion of the sun as seen from the earth it is the precise time at which the apparent ecliptic longitude of the sun is zero yes the sun s ecliptic longitude not its declination is used for the astronomical definition this precise time shifts within the civil calendar very slightly from year to year in the ecclesiastical system the vernal equinox does not shift it is fixed at march regardless of the actual motion of the sun the date of easter is a specific calendar date easter starts when that date starts for your local time zone the vernal equinox occurs at a

i just got out of a year relationship i know it s hard but i ve found it easier for me if i just focus on my work and friends go out have a good time you don t have to get a date right away give it time try and flirt a little without going overboard if a guy asks for your digits give them out no hurt in talking to someone and if your not ready for a relationship be honest and let them know that
you don t make yourself happy if you can walk talk taste smell see and hear then there are reasons to be happy right there if you were to lose even one of those capabilities then you would understand how much worse things could be however you mean relationship wise if you are in a relationship with someone then odds are that the two of you found things in each other that you liked and made the two of you happy so figure out what went wrong and see if you can fix it the number one reason for relationship failures or lack of progress is the lack of communication communication allows you to figure out what makes each other happy mad sad what each other likes to do and don t do what your favorite colors movies actors are what your religion is or isn t etc i could go on and on like i said communication is the key the make or break of everything so if you say to your self what went wrong and the answer would be for example s he doesn t give you enough attention he likes to do only the stuff he likes to do he never compliments you he is jealous or possessive he expects to much from you etc ask yourself this have i you told him about the things that bother me if the answer is yes then maybe you are communicating and he isn t so tell him he needs to communicate with you we all expect so much of each other but half the time we don t know what each other wants due to lack of communicating most of the time people start dating before they even know each other normally based on looks well looks only go so far i have dated beautiful girls who were self centered or heartless so after a while i was like srew that looks are great but not at the cost of happiness when you are with someone the two of you should always want to know what to do to make each other happy as long as neither of you are self centered then it should be effortless well i hope what i have said is helpful good luck

interesting question my first thought is that bravery is being mistaken for aggression tension is not part of bravery to be brave is a state of mind a decision attitude sounds like relaxing your mind would help you here another thought is that you are referring to an action that may require bravery such as helping a person in distress this requires your body to produce adrenaline and tension will occur bravery or courage is a mental or moral strength to persevere and withstand danger fear or difficulty think about it sometimes it could be the omission of action that is brave this is a really great topic to explore i like this one to end my response i will add that the best tension busters are exercise and mastering your thoughts thinking on good things or productive visualization i am definitely going to be thinking on this one for a while

a big but noble task i hope you pull it off first incorporate file articles of incorporation as a nonprofit with your state s secretary of state articles for this are commonly available at the sos website call them if you have questions second adopt bylaws google bylaws nonprofit name of your state and see what forms you can find third get a federal employer identification number for your company you can do this online at the first link below fourth go to second link below to download a form and instructions for form you ll fill the form out and file it with irs you ll be filing as a c public charity as opposed to private foundation assuming that most of your funds will come from the general public as opposed to from a single source the form is long pages and will take some time but the good news is it will help you think through some of the important issues the last pages are a checklist of all the filings you ll need to submit with the form fifth send the form and any other necessary docs see form checklist to irs with the filing fee either or depending on your expected revenues see part xi of form then wait it takes over months for irs to even respond to s nowadays when they respond they ll assign an agent who will likely write a letter telling you here are additional things we need and we also have these questions provide what they ask for adn respond to questions in letter and mail it all back to the agent who wrote you this process may repeat itself once or twice once irs issues a determination letter you are officially a c and can give your donors a contribution tax deduction you can actually start raising funds before you get the determination letter it will take at least months to get it and most likely longer than that if you tell your donors in writing that you have filed form and expect to receive a determination letter eventually but can t guarantee that irs will grant you c status sixth before you do any fundraising call the secretary of state in each state in which you plan to solicit funds and ask them if you need to register your nonprofit prior to soliciting funds in that state some require registration some don t seventh you need real estate you can either rent or buy but either will require you to have some net worth in the nonprofit hence the need for contributions maybe a generous landowner will let you use a house for free who knows anyway you will need several permits and licenses including a certificate of occupancy contact your city hall and tell them what you plan to do and ask what paperwork you need to fill out to get a certificate of occupancy co then contact the governmental unit either county or city that handles social services or contact your county s juvenile court and tell them your plans and ask what permits or licenses you ll need obviously this is just a starter list but if you do the above it will at least help you get off the ground the paperwork you can handle what you really need help with is money so once you get incorporated you should start fundraising you ll also need real estate and business savvy so as you start soliciting funds see if you can recruit knowledgeable people not just friends people who really know their stuff to be on your board of directors for real estate folks you might consider just cold calling a couple real estate companies e g who list and fill commercial leases and see if you can talk to someone young with an open mind maybe they ll agree to serve on your board for either the real estate or business side try to get a hold of a young lawyer at a mid to large size firm they re always eager to build their resumes good luck i real

you have two paths for this one requiring and one not requiring a degree there is a big difference in career potential and prospective salary between the two loan officer is not a bad start in the business world the skills required are not too demanding the subjects are accounting loan accounting credit worthiness assessment and risk managing loan portfolios and stuff like that you can easily learn the basic skills at a business college but when you go to work somewhere your job might be limited to certain types of loans about which you will have to learn more and you will need to absorb all the policies and procedures applicable to that workplace advancement to high positions requires a degree consumer loans are not as good a place to start as other types you will be judged on the basis of how well you conform to policy how neat and punctual you are how much money you and maybe your section or group lose or gain for the lending institution some people skills friendliness and sales skills are required lots of paperwork and periodic review and assessments if you manage car loans you may need to have skills to manage a very large database so computer proficiency is a big plus also for other work in this area your school will know about current financial and loan managment softwares reports were kept on spreadsheets in the past but i do not know what the latest techniques are nevertheless i am reasonably sure this info is solidly in the ball park a very good idea is to go to a place where you would one day like to start working and ask them if you might have the job description or hiring requirements for the type of position you want look it over very carefully and tailor your schooling to match

i agree with each of the responses ahead of me in part of course you want to pay off balances quickly particularly if they are large balances with high interest rates the finance chargees you re paying are just money out the window first things first hopefully your balances are not so high that you can t at the very least pay more than the minimum required payment next look at the card generating the highest actual finance charges and increase the amount you pay on that card to double the minimum start reducing other payments to above the minimum starting with the card generating the lowest actual finance charges follow this system until your credit balances are paid as you go along it s good to evaluate what you re spending your money on each month credit cards should only be used in emergency situations personally we use our cards for life essentials and pay off the balance each month with some limited exceptions once you ve paid off your balances cut up the cards with the highest finance charge rates but do not cancel them yet once you cancel a card you also lose allof the history which goes along with it but cutting up the cards limits your ability to use them don t cut them all save one with a low rate for use in emergencies the trick to minimizing credit card debt is discipline in spending and knowing what it is you re buying each time you use the card for every month you leave an open balance that loaf of bread tank of gas or round of drinks gets more and more expensive good luck

stock price appreciation is not to be confused with compounding compounding occurs when payouts are reinvested such as in the case of dividend reinvestment the basics are that well established companies pay a dividend and new companies do not because they would rather reinvest their earnings into the company to fund future growth that is what the street wants growth the price of a stock today is based on its future earnings or at least what investors hope will be future earnings in the end if you as an investor think that a company will never pay a dividend then modern portfolio theory will tell you that that is a stock not worth owning so for a stock to compound you need that dividend reinvested into the same stock and again that is not to be confused with price appreciation

i m going to go out on a limb here and make some suppositions since you said you are a young widow i will assume that your four children are young as well i will further assume that at least one of them is too young to even go to school or goes to school a half day i m going to also assume that your mega paying job reguires a mega amount of hours and you don t get a lot of time with your children so your choice is to provide for your children financially or emotionally but you are worried that you can t do both how am i doing so far if i am close the most obvious answer is to use a nanny or other care giver that would at least mean that your children will have someone to take care of their physical needs a better answer might be to use friends and relatives to help take care of them this is better because they can give more love to the children than a nanny would i should probably mention another possibility getting remarried taking care of children is tough it is much easier with two people

there are various ways to market a medical billing business the most important thing is networking you must know potential doctors who may need your help and services check out the doctors that you and your family use introduce your business to them ask for referrals to other doctors they know who may need your services note however that networking takes time to bear fruit and you must be patient and continue to working on getting the word out about your business you can also send out mailings to doctors in your area send a letter with a brochure detailing the services that you offer immediately follow up your mailings with calls if you can set up a meeting with potential clients so you can personally present to them your business another strategy is to try cold calling on the doctors although you may not be able to talk with the doctor given their usual tight schedules instead you can simply leave your business card and marketing materials to the receptionists if the clinic or doctor s office does not allow for soliciting it would be best if you could just send out that particular office with a direct mailing piece

there are several things you can do to fix your credit score first if you have not already done so obtain a copy of your complete credit report from all three bureaus this will show you what debts you currently have and how much you owe it will also show and judgements or liens you may have if you have a lot of credit card debt start paying as much as you can on the card with the highest interest rate and pay the minimum on the others it is very important to pay on time as each late payment counts against you if you can t afford to pay the minimums on all the cards you may be able to call them and re negotiate your payment if they won t negotiate send them something every month by the due date even if its only dollars its better than no payment at all once you have paid off one of the cards close the account and begin to pay down the next one using an online bill pay service to set up automatic payments will help a lot its a pain to sit down and write out checks and address and stamp them all auto payments send your payment without you doing anything and it will stop late payments continue this strategy until you have at the most two credit cards thats all the normal consumer should need it takes time but its better than filing for bankruptcy which will ruin you for at least years if you have judgements or liens contact the agency that filed it and make arrangements with them judgements and liens must be paid before any lender will approve you for a home loan if you have credit cards in collection where the credit card company has written you off as a bad debt don t pay those off just let them ride by paying on them you make the account active again and it will actually lower your score eventually they will fall off your report most lenders don t look at collection accounts that are older than two years if you have a collection account on your report that is older than years write the credit reporting agency and tell them to remove it they can t legally leave it on there after years if you don t have enough credit you can get a secured credit card with most any bank use it for large purchases like a tv or lawnmower and then pay the balance off each month only use it for items that you have the cash to pay for don t let the balance carry over on this new card by paying it off every month the credit card company will offer you a higher credit limit and you can continue to build that limit and good credit standing to the point that other credit card companies will begin to send you offers at that point you can get a second card but again you need to run the balance up and then pay it off you can build credit this way quickly in review pay your credit cards every month even if you cant pay the minimum pay them off one at a time by paying the most you can one one card until you pay it off then move to the next don t pay credit cards that are written off they won t do you any good pay off any liens or judgements they can kill your credit score and they never go away until you pay them most lenders want to see at least lines of good credit to make a home loan to you two credit cards and a car loan will establish this for you one last thing don t use your credit cards to buy stuff like groceries fast food etc it gets you in the habit of living beyond your means and runs your bills up to quickly

first you have to realize and accept the fact that there is and won t be any easy way out of your debt without certain consequences here are a few suggestions from someone who s been and done that go to a debt consolidation company they will make negotiations on your behalf with your creditors for a lower monthly payment basically you will make a agreed upon monthly payment to this company and they will in turn disburse the money to each of the creditor each month you can call them and tell them your situation as far as the amount of debt and your income i can suggest one i ve used in the past debt options in fl it will have a negative impact on your credit score but at least you will be able to pay down the debt in a fairly short time and you will only have to repay a small percentage of the actual debt maybe around file bankruptcy this is the fastest and least painful way you can file for chapter and just walk away from all of the debt even though the laws have changed you can still file for a chpater or bankruptcy depending on your particular situation you would have to speak with a bankruptcy lawyer the fees are probably around to if you have been in debt for years then you really need to review your situation seriously and make a decision if you truly want to regain control of your life and finances it sound that at your current pace you will still be in debt another years from now as painful as my suggestions may sound it at least provides a way out for you and then you can start all over with a clean slate no debts trust mem there are millions of people filing bankruptcies every year so it is not a life ending move but rather a way to give you a new start it s your life you can decide as you wish good luck

percent change pc the percent change pc in rates over a particular time period is calculated by taking the difference between the average rate of the first two years and the average rate of the last two years the difference is then divided by the average rate of the first two years and multiplied by to convert it to a percent formula for percent change annual percent change apc the annual percent change apc is calculated by fitting a least squares regression line to the natural logarithm of the rates using the calendar year as a regressor variable n number of years r rates y ln r x calendar year y mx b apc em because the methods used in the calculation of pc and apc are not directly related it is possible that the signs of the pc and the apc may disagree see calculating apc with weighting for the formulas used in calculating weighted apcs significance test apc to testing the hypothesis that the apc is equal to zero is equivalent to testing the hypothesis that the regression parameter m is equal to zero the hypothesis is rejected at a significance level p if probt abs m sem n p where probt x n is the t distribution function evaluated at x and with n degrees of freedom and where sem is the standard error of m from the regression standard error for apc the standard error i e sem is obtained from the fit of the regression this calculation assumes that the rates increased or decreased at a constant rate over the entire calendar year interval the validity of this assumption is not assessed in those few instances where at least one of the rates is equal to zero the linear regression is not calculated see kleinbaum kupper and muller applied regression analysis and other multivariable methods pws kent boston mass nd edition confidence intervals for apc the endpoints of a p x confidence interval are calculated as formula for confidence intervals for eapc where tval tinv p n is the inverse of the t distribution function evaluated at p and with n degrees of freedom note in seer stat you specify the p value as opposed to the confidence interval the confidence interval p x therefore a confidence interval is specified by p significance test apc to apc the differences between trends for two time periods are tested for statistical significance by comparing the difference in regression coefficients divided by the standard error of that difference with a t distribution with degrees of freedom defined as the sum of the years in both time periods minus kleinbaum

there s several criteria that determine how much traffic your website gets but by far the most important things are to have a good ranking in the search engines and some good links to your site search engines use a complicated algorithm to determine which sites are placed where in the rankings the results returned by a search engine and these algorithms are a closely guarded secret there are various articles on the net to do with search engine optimization or seo but i ignore all of them and do things my way this seems to work as every site i ve created ranks within the top on google even when there s up to million other results found a site i created just a few days ago is already ranked number by yahoo the only major search engine to have indexed the site so far these are some of my tips give your page a good title one of the key things a search engine looks at is the title of the page when you re giving the page a title use the same words that people are likely to key in when using a search engine for example if you re going to create a page about space travel then a title such as space travel be a shuttle rocket tourist and journey to the moon would be far better than all about flying to the moon and back because the first phrase includes many keywords that people are likely to use in a search engine such as space travel shuttle rocket tourist journey and moon give your page a relevant name search engines also look at page names if your domain was mydomain com then a page name luch as mydomain com space travel will do much better than mydomain com section part page use the description tag some search engines supoort this tag others don t google is one of those that does what it means is that the details of the site that users see when your site shows up in the search results are the details yopu want them to see and not random snippets from the page for example compare a yahoo search for black eyed peas to a google search both of them find blackeyedpeas com but yahoo describe it as multi platinum time grammy winners the black eyed peas cross an historic threshold as their hit the black eyed peas sergio mendes john legend justin timberlake and others whereas google uses the description tag and describes it as official site includes videos message boards tour dates and photo gallery additional content is available to members put a heading on your page the heading should closely match the page title you need to format the heading as a heading style and not simply use bold and underlined text repeat the keywords frequently you need to include in the text of your page several instances of the different keywords people may key in when using a search engine using the space travel example your page should include words such as space travel fly moon space tourist and so on with each of these words repeated several times at the same time don t overdo it if you keep repeating the same thing ove and over and over again the search engines don t like it use of the keyword tag this is something that s falling out of favour with search engines and in my experience could be detrimental to page ranking keywords are added to the page itself but aren t visible to people browsing the page this was a useful tag for ensuring your page contained varients of words particularly those that are often mis spelled e g britney britany brittany spears spiers etc personally i don t use keywords any more don t try to cheat the system some web pages hide text by printing white text on a white background for example often such text has nothing at all to do with the site but is just a list of popular words and phrases the hope is that som

ok best investment that you can make is education not necessarily formal education but education nonetheless any bookstore or your local library will have racks and racks of investment books the biggest thing that you have to keep telling yourself is this my broker is a salesman and nothing else every hot tip you act on from him gives him a commission whether you make money or lose money it makes no difference to him nobody cares more about your money than you so learn everything you can about it start by building up a month cash reserve in a savings account this is money that is not to be spent but is there for a rainy day and it will rain lots of days after that consider some liquid investments such as gic s or t bills you can purchase t bills online at http www treasurydirect gov indiv indiv htm it is easy to do and you cut out the middleman by dealing directly with the treasury treasury bills are exempt from state taxes making them a better bet than many others and there are no safer term deposits learn how to do your own taxes learn the different rates for income dividends capital gains it s not how much you make it s how much you keep that s important do not cheat on your taxes you will lose far too much this way after that consider some mutual funds you will get diversification at relatively low fees watch the fees though after that consider investing on your own at that point you will not need anybody else s advice

i ve seen credit analysts come from two domains risk analyst and accounting acountants are typically best equipped to obtain analyze a firm s exposure to determine a rating however they miss what a risk analyst provides that forward view of the firm a credit risk analyst marries the two by being able to see a firm s credit related exposures quantify and compare it against benchmark credit rating agencies fitch s p etc often a firm s credit risk is reflected in its bonds and occasionally in its stock price therefore you can enumerate needed skills as follows accounting risk bonds and fundamental analysis i ve seen clerks accountants become credit analysts but the path i write of takes you to a higher level i e you may be happy now granting credit to self employed gardeners getting loans for trucks but you might want to aim higher down the road so it s worth getting yourself educated if you can afford it

sounds familiar i had a neighbor like this when i lived in a dorm at college if she even heard a peep from our room she would come over banging on our door and yelling curse words at us after the year ended and i moved out i thought of all kinds of fun things i could have done to her one favorite thing was to go home on the weekend and forget to turn off your alarm clock no one wants to be awakened at am on a saturday morning another thing i thought of doing the ceilings in the dorm are the drop down panels with silver framing around each one the cement block walls went above the drop down ceiling but didn t go all the way up to the ceiling above that you had about inches of space between the top of the wall and the ceiling if you lifted up the drop down panels and you had enough room to throw things over onto the drop down ceiling of your neighbor s room i thought about throwing ice over when she wasn t there so it would melt and drip all over her stuff but the best way to deal with your neighbor is to just leave it alone things have a way of coming back around to people who are mean they ll get whats coming to them or you could actually start stomping since your landlord is on your side he ll believe you right

honestly there s not much you can do you can try to talk to a guidance counselor or teacher and that might help the only thing that worked for me when i was in school was ignoring the crap that was said there was this one girl who bullied me for years and we would consequently bad mouth each other finally i just quit saying anything about her and let her talk all the trash she wanted to our mutual friends realized after a while that she was the one causing all the drama and so even though she was still talking trash about me our friends just tuned her out when she would do that and it made me look like the better person which of course i am

first of all no offense just like if you were to go job hunting you need to use a spell checker buyers and purchasers are the people at companies like walmart that decide whether to purchase a product from someone depending on what the product is i would look for a tradeshow that advertises buyers of major retailers in attendance for example check out retail visions at www visionevents com if you sell a technology product this is the place you need to be however be prepared to shell out k or more just to attend also walmart won t buy from you unless the see promise in a long term relationship that means you should expect to open an office in bentonville hope this answer isn t too negative the reality is that doing business with walmart is not easy but if you can succeed then obviously it will be fruitful

the classical fundamental analysis approach is to compare the various ratios of similar stocks and declare the one with the worst ratios undervalued so if stock a has a price earnings ratio of and stock b has a price earnings ratio of and their prospects are equally good then a fundamental analyst might declare stock a undervalued if the stock price then goes up the analyst is a genius but if they both go down they were both obviously overvalued a few people can play this game successfully but i think there s a fatal flaw to this approach that makes it very difficult for an amateur to play this approach assumes that the market is stupid and an individual can outsmart it i would argue that the market is rarely stupid it s just overreactive and overemotional the only time a stock is reliably undervalued is when transitory or irrelevant news induces overreactive selling there are periods when stocks reporting earnings a penny below expectations are routinely hammered to per cent if the company isn t totally negative on the future there is usually a bounceback as bargain hunters come in my favorite undervaluation moment is when an analyst downgrades a stock and knocks it down per cent most analysts aren t any smarter than the market if the company is doing well and the stock is in a decent uptrend it will recover in a few hours or days this disturbs many people but the truth is prices are driven by emotion and psychology not financial ratios an ordinary person can take advantage of this fact when emotion gets out of hand i think this is a more reasonable goal than trying to be the next warren buffett in one s spare time

all s i can say is do your research pull up your credit report and learn the ins and outs of it and what the numbers mean as far as the cost of financing if you have been declined some form of credit credit cards loans orre financeing within the past six months you can get a free credit report from any known credit bureaus i personally use experian http www experian com i cannot say exactly how to achieve your own home but my parents went through this most places can give you a quote before sending the credit application to process of how much your interest with the principle will be within the given time it should be paid off you might also have a shot by calling a couple of those bad credit financing institutions you see commercials about on tv the only problem is the interest rates are not low and the longer it takes to pay off the principle the more it will cost you no matter the promises they make that mask the truth behind the pretty lettering always read the fine print before you sign anything and ask what it means in plain english if you do not understand it can t hurt to know i also would pay attention to auctioned off properties from banks credit unions and reposession collection companies they go off of credit but it can be cheaper even with bad credit though most of those properties are some real fixer uppers either way you will have to work at it in the long run these properties are sometimes financed cheaper because the holders of the property want to get rid of them asap the key is you cannot skip a beat in paying the bill this may drive the interest up or add pricey fees to the balance which will make it harder to pay off in the time allotted which is dictated monthly on your credit report and this will make it harder down the road to clear up sometimes if you sweettalk your financial adviser you can come up with a contract that has little or no money down but this is added to your balance and is subject to any and all interest the rest of the principle is there is also the issue of how much debt you are in already the more money you have going out versus your take home pay that can also effect the yes or no on the financing first off you can have bad credit and not be in debt you can also be in debt but have exelent credit that s something you need to pay attention to like i said do your research this issue is different with everyone because everyone s credit score is different wether good or bad so there is not a set course to get what you want

overcoming shyness and social phobia shyness sometimes inaccurately called social phobia affects most people at some time in their life young people in particular find overcoming shyness difficult as they improve their social skills and for some shyness seems to persist into adult life almost as if it has become a habit shyness has its roots in self consciousness and usually dissipates as people mature and become more experienced however for some it can stick and then action is required although most people think in terms of overcoming shyness it is more likely that you will become comfortable in social situations by learning the strategies of self confidence along with social skills then shyness is no longer the issue as social nerves will melt away as a new habit takes their place shyness versus social phobia it is my personal opinion that social phobia is too often diagnosed where people are simply experiencing natural shyness it is perfectly natural to be a little timid in a situation where you don t yet know the rules or what to do in fact most people experience some degree of nerves when say going to meet friends especially if it is somewhere they haven t been before or someone new will be there we have to be very careful not to assume that there is something wrong with this social nerves are natural as long as they don t get out of hand focusing on them and making them into a big thing will only make matters worse when learning about social situations young people need the chance to find their own way without being labeled with social phobia this is not to say that social phobia does not exist i know it does because i have worked with people suffering from it however in the vast majority of cases the solution is social skills training and perhaps relaxation and rehearsal rather than drugs if a person can maintain a degree of calmness in a situation then they are much more likely to be able to learn about how the situation works however if they are highly anxious and internally focused both their emotional state and focus of attention will make it more difficult to pick up on subtle social cues the other key point about overcoming shyness is that most of socialising is an unconscious process that doesn t mean you should be asleep when you re doing it tell that to people i speak to at parties it simply means that much of human communication is non verbal that is it s not what you say it s the way that you say it if you become highly anxious this will tend to focus your conscious mind on your immediate environment getting in the way of those unconscious processes tips for overcoming shyness check out the tips in the article on self consciousness particularly the ones to do with where you focus your attention practise becoming fascinated by other people ask them about themselves and concentrate when they answer you remember what they tell you about themselves so you can talk about it later or on another occasion great socialisers make other people feel comfortable and interesting how do they do that by being really genuinely interested in other people if you are talking to someone and you feel boring or inferior ask why that is is it really all your fault practise using fewer personal pronouns when you talk about things sentences beginning with i are not only a turn off for the listener they also keep the focus of attention on you which increases shyness note of course part of friendship is giving away things about yourself but only when you feel it is appropriate to do so remember that the way to overcome shyness is to focus elsewhere like on imagining what it will be like to really enjoy the social event on how it will feel to be full of energy or to

oh my i have seen exactly the same thing happen in one of my places of employment he did not ever abuse me but he did abuse many other people and he was in a position of enough power that he could get away with it i know how tough this is to deal with my method of handling him was to be very good at what i did and to present myself in a very assertive manner sometimes people came to me in tears when he had abused them and my advice to them was to react to him in an unexpected manner these people get their satisfaction when their victims act like victims try to find ways to react differently to him so that he doesn t get satisfaction from the abuse i can t tell you what that reaction might be because it depends on him and what he is like but that is probably the only way to cope with him if it is a similar situation to mine you won t be able to touch him he is probably in quite a protected position i am sure if there was anyone to report him to you would have done that so form an informal support group we did that have a plan to support each other don t give him the reward of reacting the way he wants you to react i would also strongly recommend that you keep detailed dated records of events try to never be alone with him always have witnesses if you are a member of a union go to your union representative and explain what has been happening i hope these thoughts help good luck with sorting this

employers have to like them enough for the employers to be willing to go through the hoop of sponsoring them the hib process is quick and is the usual route taken by employers but employers more committed to them would take them through the labor certification process which is about years process your friends must impress potential employers a lot for the employers to want to keep them and go through the expense of sponsoring them the sponsorship process is not cheap and it is not easy
contrary to what the poster above me said a non us citizen cannot get federal jobs us citizenship is a requirement for government jobs find a us company in your field and see if they will sponsor you if they do they can proceed with employment based application for green card where you get employment approval first from department of labor e g the employer needs to prove that no americans can fill the job as well as you and that they tried to look for an american to fill the job to no avail it can be a long process depending on the state or they can put you on the fast track h b process but you can only stay for a maximum of years i suggest you start looking for recruiters in your area e g nurses are one in demand job who can connect you with potential employers or you can come to the us on a visitors visa and try your luck in getting a job while you have valid visa

too sensitive how to toughen up enjoy your sensitivity not everybody is sensitive it can however be hurtful in a less sensitive world there is a way to tolerate this world not to take anything personally what people throw out and at others is mainly an expression of their own problems you may want to tell yourself this is this person s problem i am not taking on his her mood nastiness etc nor do i react to it the same way you may want to try to smile forgive and turn away and release those from your life who are too insensitive if you can some people however need some drastic feed back after polite and gentle approaches have failed example a male student would always make some nasty remarks to a female student when standing in line at the cafeteria which embarrassed her she was not used to such language she planned an answer one day she finally said very loud to him this can only come from a boy with a low iq as yours is he obviously felt embarrassed to hear this from a girl in front of all the other students waiting in line amazingly this was the remedy for him he never bothered her again example another boy would enter late in the lecture hall at the university when he detected where a certain girl was sitting he would walk up to her and in passing squeeze her cheek she was too shy to protest aloud and interrupt the lecture but she planned a response one day she came in later then he used to be and walked up to him and whole heartedly squeezed his cheek he left the girl alone after this if you are too sensitive to noise hypericum perforatum works wonders that s how you may like to take it place pills on milk sugar base only in ounce of purified water take a drop under your tongue very often until the sensitivity gats less then take it less and less often but at least times a day to keep up the effect in the daily wear and tear non addictive nontoxic make fresh every day make less if less is needed i feel that it is most important in life not to take things personally and to love your neighbor as yourself bible that is we should not harbor resentment but should let go and be free be you enjoy your sensitivity you may want to use it to tune into the finer worlds and experiences may be through meditation you may be able to learn to sense ahead find lost items or help others long distance that s what sensitive people can become good at it is all energy and energy travels fast and everywhere we send it may you enjoy your sensitivity cordially india magica

first off are you trying to land a job as a door attendant at a hotel apartment or bar more of a bouncer type job if you re trying to become a doorman at a private residence i d say you are out of luck unless you are in a big city such as nyc i m not very familiar with bouncer positions as i try to avoid food beverage workplaces i can help you out with a hotel position as i have recently been hired as a doorman at a wonderful downtown hotel i like to remain anonymous online so i ll withhold the name check out local hotels that are either very large or luxury properties a downtown location would help marriott s hilton s westin s and ritz carlton s would be a good place to start most job applications are taken online but large hotel corporations but i would advise going to the hotel or at least calling to find out about job availability and the application process if a job is available make sure to attach a professional carefully written resume to the application learn about the company and craft the resume to their goals and expectations always remember whatever the company to focus on service and customer interaction the hospitality industry is obviously very concerned with these qualities and they are even more important for a doorman position be prepared for the interview again research the company ask pertinent questions that display effort into understanding the company as well as seriousness about accepting the position look your best as they will be looking for someone who is a good ambassador for their hotel be professional courteous and always wear a smile a doorman position may seem like an easy job to get however it is not the case door attendants are the front line of the hotel and make a first impression on a guest this be an important factor in determining overall guest satisfaction in addition most hotels that have door attendants are very upscale and are more difficult to be accepted into for example i went through three interviews for my position speaking with hr my department head and the director of operations an individual who reports only to the general manager do not take the job lightly and always remember to act professional and hospitable on a final note consider if you are the right person for the job before applying this one very important question will help to get you started can i be professional and act kindly at all times the job is based almost solely on guest interaction therefore this is very important guests may mistreat you stiff you out of a tip have outlandish requests and may make you listen to their personal problems as well as their bad mouthing of your organization if you can handle this and still wear a genuine smile you will succeed if you cannot you will either not get the job or be absolutely miserable an important note to add is that levels of professionalism vary by hotel brand for instance the famous ritz carlton brand focuses on rigid scripted interaction with guests while the westin another luxury hotel requires professional interactions yet encourages personal connections with guests and a more genuine personality regardless of the brand remember that you must truly have a servant s heart in order to take this job keep this in mind when choosing a hotel to apply to

learning to advocate for yourself is both an important and learnable skill there is no reason for consumers to be unhappy with the goods and services they receive a respectful and thoughtful though forceful letter of grievance can turn a lemon into lemonade here is how to do it steps be polite being rude won t get you anywhere use a reserved and respectful tone try to avoid accusing someone of something untoward in reality unless the company you have dealt with is intent on defrauding you the people you have dealt with in the company mean for you to be happy so that you will come back and bring friends keep on point and get to the point fast do not tell the whole story how you got to the store who was with you what you had for breakfast only give the facts that are pertinent to your case and fact pattern send copies of reciepts and bills of lading as well as checks you sent and if appropriate photos or videos etc all documentation should go with your letter you do not need to send sworn letters of witnesses in fact if you think you might wind up in court over this you might want to hold back not only the witness statement but her name as well never threaten legal action if you intend to go that route send your letter first then if the response is not adequate write to a supervisor and then see an attorney he will know just what to do if the supervisor s letter receives an unsatisfactory response legal action is your last resort and leading with it in your letters sets a negative tone and may come back to bite you if your bluff is called work up the chain of command each time you move from customer service rep to supervisor to director to vice president to ceo you should attach the correspondence you have had at the previous level this will update your new company representative and very possibly get the matter resolved in a non litigious way if you go right to the top chances are the ceo is not going to know what you are talking about or why you are upset he will only have half a story yours and if he investigates will not know who to talk to tips do not write the letter at the moment when you are angry wait until you have calmed down take some time and refelct on what has occurred when you have thought the whole thing out and know just what you want and how you want to ask for it you will be ready to write your letter be sure your letter includes your name address e mail and phone number home work and cell if possible also be sure to ask for the reader s information as well so you can be kept and keep them up to date on your case if you are writing to complain about a specific person limit your letter to their shortcomings and do not disparage the organization as a whole if you are writing to complain about a policy of the company do not insult the listener or the policy just state your problem and how you want it to get fixed warnings it is illegal to write a letter that contains threatening language if you threaten someone even with a law suit it can be held that you aggravatedly harassed someone and you could get a criminal record for sending the letters

depending on our situation meeting people to become friends with can be very easy or extremely difficult clubs local organizations activities schools church libraries book stores gyms jogging parks beach lakes malls etc can all be places to meet new people once you ve met them talking and keeping the person interested is probably the most important thing to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask simple friendly questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc become genuinely interested in the other person there are lots of ways to start a conversation keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice for other topics to talk about you can search the internet about things that you or the people you will be talking with are interested in if you like games perhaps search for the latest information about the x box games pc games ps revolution etc if you like tv shows movies books pets etc a few jokes from time to time can also be a great ice breaker also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written

i suggest searching a full text business database like abi inform global you can find databases like these at your local library i found articles doing a quick search for kmart s bankruptcy here is one of them at a time when discount stores such as kohl s target and walmart are recording strong sales kmart corp the granddaddy of them all last week declared bankruptcy several factors contributed to the downfall but one of the biggest is that kmart didn t compete on price a failure some attribute to its inability to master supply chain technology and consequently benefit from supply chain efficiencies as wal mart moved away from a promotions driven business model which relies on special sales to bring customers into stores to one that focuses on everyday low prices kmart stuck with the former approach which results in sharp spikes and drops in demand for products analysts say sale merchandise often was out of stock when customers got to the store one reason for that is that it s hard to get supply chain management software to work in that model without a lot of customization and kmart never built a supply chain planning and execution system to effectively manage demand says eric beder an equity analyst at ladenburg thalmann who tracks kmart over the years some at kmart saw the need for better software to manage demand but beder says top executives never executed on that vision meanwhile wal mart built an e business system to regularly communicate sales and inventory data from every store to thousands of suppliers and buyers and deploy a private trading hub to consolidate its purchasing globally and bring suppliers online to bid on contracts all part of a plan to lower costs and pass on savings promotions don t cause delivery problems for wal mart because of its tight links with suppliers the contrast between the retailers supply chain systems has been evident in stores says gartner analyst gale daikoku who worked in the retail industry wal mart has almost no supply storage areas because its vendormanaged inventory system makes suppliers responsible for delivering product when wal mart needs it she says at kmart stores daikoku says it wasn t unusual for a supplier s sales representative wanting to discover why something wasn t selling at a certain branch to find shelves empty but products piled up in stockrooms kmart has tried to change in the last months new packaged logistics and proprietary merchandising software helped the retailer improve its dismal record of getting holiday promotional shipments in on the date they re promised to customers ceo charles conaway who joined in june contracted with i technologies inc that october for logistics monitoring and transportation management software and a custom version of tradematrix supply chain management software but the retailer never implemented tradematrix says steve robinson executive vp with i and liaison to kmart shortly after signing the contract conaway concluded that kmart needed to reengineer its business first to improve its dealings with suppliers last fall conaway unveiled an it project based on manhattan associates software and estimated at million to manage the flow of clothing toys auto parts and other consumer goods into stores nearly items in the process he wrote off two distribution centers and it assets reportedly including some i supply chain software and warehouse management software from exe technologies inc worth million a kmart spokesperson says the exe software was so heavily modified that it cost too much to maintain observers say management s historic inability to fully execute on innovative it efforts may play a role in kmart s rapid cio turnover four cios have left or moved to other positions in the las
you have square feet of storage assuming that the storage is feet high that would give you cubic feet of storage volume if that is all you can afford i assume that the sq feet is actually the square footage of your apt or house rather than the furniture itself ultimately whether it is posssible or not will depend on the total volume of what you want to store the first thing is to look at the largest items and decide if they need to be stored are they really what you want later do you have any friends who could use them until you are ready for them stacking strategy usually entails putting the larger items into a container first then fitting the smaller items in the remaining spaces an exception to this is storage of boxes which should start off in a corner of the space and stack with the heavier less fragile items on the bottom and the lighter less sturdy boxes higher pillows blankets other somewhat durable softgoods can be stored in a way to protect furniture or other items you don t want scratched finally you need to identify the items that you need access to and to make sure they are stored at the entrance to the space so you don t have to dig through everything to get to them remember we often leave things in storage longer than we originally plan to good luck

free email providers such as yahoo or hotmail will not notify you if you have problems in receiving emails they are afterall a free service first check your spam filters and the level of filtering your account is doing you may have inadvertently changed the settings and turned it to high where any emails sent from anyone not in your list is bounced for me i make sure that my emails are directed to several accounts but this is my domain name s email and my web hosting provider gives options on how to handle emails what i do is to send the emails to my main email e g email email com and any emails sent to that address is directed to several email accounts yahoo hotmail gmail and my isp so even if my isp conks out and blocks emails i can still get my emails in my other accounts you can never be too sure with emails so it is better to have backups

you want quality hits i m assuming that your business is within a certain locale which means that getting placed in a broad category such as nanny service on google or yahoo s search engine is going to yield a lot of garbage traffic you may want to focus on regional search engine ranking terms like your city nanny service with your city being where you are located i won t go into how to get listed and ranked in search engines here because it s beyond the scope of the this forum if you want to get ranked in the search engines i suggest you do some homework or hire someone also get listed on dmoz org a lot of people pull their directory content from dmoz including google this means you ll get listed on a lot of web sites just by being in dmoz also look for web sites that make a natural fit for your service locally and ask to do a link exchange this helps in two ways first you are listed on a targeted web site where you will get direct traffic and secondly it helps your overall search ranking to have more sites linked to your site in addition look for free listing sites to post a listing like as someone else mentioned craigslist org there are more of these types of sites out there also this sounds obvious but make sure your url is on every piece of business collateral and advertising you put out there another thing you should do is use the power of word of mouth tell everyone you meet and talk to locally about the web site this is where an easy to remember url comes in handy as well as every business conversation you have you should mention your web site you never know who will tell whom about your site and finally talk to the business editor of your local paper s and or business magazine and try and get a story written on your web site and or business if your town is small enough you can also talk to your local tv stations into doing a story on you most small market stations have small business spotlight segments this all comes from years of experience in working with small business clients my additional advice would be that you spend a little money and join your local chamber of commerce they often provide free member listings on their web site as well as providing network to help market your business amongst other business people

karma is a tricky thing and yet it is very easy to understand first a few things you need to understand karma is not something that is awarded or deducted based on some universal guidebook and dispenses or handed out by a mystical karma deity karma is a direct result of your own unborn nature reacting to the things you say do and think all sentient beings have what we call a conscious mind a subconscious mind and an unborn or buddha mind the unborn mind is that part of us that is innately good when we learn to use only the unborn mind or more accurately unlearn the ignoring of the unborn then we reach enlightenment however until such time as we surrender to the unborn it is responsible for all our karma when we behave in a bad manner or when we think improper thoughts the unborn mind incapable of lying to itself directs our lives in accordance to the universal law of cause and effect a k a karma sometimes these effects are easily recognizable for instance we have bad dreams about people we love who we have treated badly this the unborn mind influencing the subconscious mind which in turn influences our conscious mind through our dreams or perhaps we have a deep feeing of guilt that gnaws away at our minds until we are compelled to tell the truth this is the unborn directly affect our conscious mind other times the works of karma are not so easy to see he take actions that cause harm and then we say to our selves why did i do that i knew it was a bad idea this is the unborn acting directly on the subconscious mind the hardest to see and accept however is when the unborn mind interacts directly with our lives for instance a person is greedy selfish and treats others unkindly thought there life when there body gives out their unborn mind reviews their life without ego attachment or lies then when the person is reborn they may be reborn in the realm of hell until they burn up their bad karma or perhaps they return as a person who is extremely ill or who lives in a poor nation with little hope of escaping poverty and hunger the unborn mind passes judgment and is that cause of all karmic punishment it is important to remember that the ward karma translates as action and often indicates intent or cause the sum of our previous actions this life or past lives creates our present state and the actions we perform now will create our future state until we break the uncontrolled cycle of rebirth buy removing illusions from our life and embrace the buddha mind or unborn mind and thus enter nirvana so is short bad karma is the result of past actions and could be the result of actions from previous lives it is best to just accept it and make do by accepting our karma as just punishment we help burn it away however it is also important to remember that not everything that goes wrong in your life is a result of karma if a man walks up to you and slaps you in the face because he doesn t like the color of your shoes that was his choice to do so his karma has been effected yours will be effected by how you respond by respond i mean what you do how you act what you say and what you think remember you can t hide anything from the unborn mind i hope this helps

actually the first person that answered is incorrect you will want to keep your high balance credit cards it is called a trust thing lenders look at high limit credit cards as a good thing because if you have a high limit credit card and you barely owe anything on it they think that you are responsible enough not to go into debt and plus if other lenders are trusting you with high limits why shouldn t they you surely want to get as much paid on them as you can even try to pay all of them off and keep one of them revolving to show you are still credit worthy make sure you always pay on time and always pay more then the minium payment never pay late and never let anything go to collections keep in mind this goes for utility bills as well if you are a first time buyer then you will want to make sure that you aren t late on any of you gas bills or phone bills or anything like that because they might look at that as well

you will probably get lots of different answers but my opinion on what makes a good sales person is this product knowledge yours and your competitors you have to know how to position your product and respond to any objections to be able to effectively offer your product as a solution to meet the buyers need develop a relationship built upon trust honesty integrity your competitor may do the hard sell but developing an honest relationship will lead to word of mouth referrals and customers for life get to know the individual their office staff gate keepers their business their competition their market space so that you can position your product to completely meet their needs once you have developed a relationship and you know your product is the right solution ask for the business customers expect it and if you have responded to any objections developed an honest relationship then you should be in a nice position to close the deal for customer that provide on going sales thank them for the business let me know how important they are and that you value them as a customer ask them to recommend your product to colleagues good luck

every state the laws are a little different in california if the case was dismissed like the previous answered stated there is nothing to expunge because that s what an expungement does the judge changes your plea to not guilty and dismisses your case what you want to do is petition to seal and destroy arrest records pursuant to penal code section again in california if you go to the court where the case was handled you can get all the paper work there the clerks can t give you legal advice but they will tell you how to complete the petition just be very polite to them petition to seal an arrest record maybe a little more tricky than an expungement because you have to get the police involved there are organizations that offer free or discounted legal advice and or service look in to that be aware that i am not a lawyer this information is from my personal experience only also seems like a good deal that s the cost of an expungement here and to seal an arrest record they want to charge over good luck

hi gharsha my experience throughout group discussions is that you should demonstrate actively your mentality but with correctness and intelligence indeed being relaxed and confident helps a lot but not to the point they perceive you may be too comfortable or even arrogant yes perceptions count and often they buy in the wrong ones when it comes to a personal interview is easier because you don t have to compete only to be honest and give the interviewer as much useful info as you can some questions are surprisingly ambiguous e g talk me about you don t panic you have to follow a coherent line so sometimes is good for you to require a more specific question keeping your nice smile oh yes like about how i look at myself or about my family about my past student experience about my latest work experience obviously the answers are free but being a little bit more specific info helps you not to panic and getting your mind in blank i guess the most difficult part comes when they ask you to talk about future great businessmen have warned me you ve just to tell companies what they expect to listen if you plan to study a master or doctorate in france within years probably they won t hire someone who will quit the company in an early future so don t say it you dream to work in that company and you ll be there the rest of your life working for them that s what they expect to listen despite the prior make it clear you re a person with ambitions and not mediocre just keep your aces under your sleeves gotcha they hire what they need and believe me when you re not useful to them anymore it d be real strange if they don t fire you for me too that s a tough point but hey it s globalization and nowadays loyalty doesn t exist at all likely a multi national company just buy a little company and then everybody s out additionally is always interesting to ask about the performance growing development career opportunities and the golden rule the salary and benefits package always always are discussed at the end of interviews or negotiations don t even mention it if they don t touch that issue wait at the end when they seem to be so interested on you if the company is real good and you really project yourself staying there some time you can always sacrifice a little money exchanging it for experience vitae training or relationships in order to escalate to better positions in that company or any other one i hope those tips helped you please pardon my english mistakes but spanish catalan and french really mix my mind up good luck and tell me if you succeed alfonso

well if you don t have a lot of money your best bet is by cheap stocks they re usually high risk high reward you have to do plenty of research go to http www morningstar com or msn money websites for research on the company that you are going to invest in i highly recommend watching mad money w jim cramer on cnbc it s on at pm he is a genius you can t buy stocks through any company you must purchase them through a broker i have sharebuilder but you can use any other online trading firm okay i probably am wrong on this after reading other s posts there is no way to get rich super quick it s a game and you have to study to learn how to play read up on dollar averaging it s where you buy more stock when the price is low and less stock when the price is higher it only works if you invest the same amount on a timely basis one more thing about sharebuilder com they do not require you to buy a whole share you can buy fractional shares

i only know mortgage loans depends a bank may sell the closed loan to fnma or fhlmc fannie mae or freddie mac the quasi govt agencies or they may sell the loan to another institution which may do the same this is called the secondary market the relationship has already been set up so there is no real marketing involved mortgage bankers may do the same or act more like brokers brokers receive numerous offers from wholesale lenders wanting closed loans both in person and by fax e mail daily the wholesale lenders are promoting their buy rates service like quick undewriting time and programs to brokers a broker may send a loan file to the wholesaler s underwriter to determine if they will approve the loan and under what conditions because that could be most important or the broker may contact wholesale reps look at rate program sheets and faxes and make a decision in many cases brokers will give their business to the or wholesalers whose service pricing and programs they are most comfortable with there are peculiarities here there but that s it in a brief nutshell it sometimes depends on the determining factor since interest rate premium paid from the wholesaler who has which program which underwriter is requiring too much paperwork or which wholesaler will even approve the loan may be the determining factor hope that addresses the question
well first figure out the reasons why you think you deserve a raise and then put yourself in your boss shoes would you give someone like you a raise i mean what sets you apart from the other employees to where you think you should get a raise after that and you feel confident with your reasons then i say go for it find the right time to approach your boss ask if he she has a moment to talk with you when you get the moment start off with something like you know i ve been here for xx months or years and i think i ve been progressing very well don t you think that starts a positive dialogue between the two of you after you have talked about your performance and even about things that you may need to work on you can ask for your raise this way your boss does not feel like you are attacking him her with a speech in which your are demanding a raise it should not be that way instead you and your boss are both contributing to the conversation and both feel like you are geting something out of the discussion even if you don t get the raise at least you will get some guidance on how to be more productive at your workplace so you can get that raise good luck
you get product promotion and price promotion product promotion is when you get another product when you make a purchase an example would be you purchase a burger and you get another burger free or you get a movie ticket or a toy especially in kiddie meals etc price promotion is when you get a discount on the product you are purchasing ex buy one and get the second half price or you get a discount voucher after making a purchase etc promotion comes into play when you introduce a new product in the market and you want people to try it when you want to get rid of stock especially perishable goods remember most products have a shelf life when you want to prevent a new competitor from entering the market and establishing themselves it s simply a purchasing incentive

prima facie i do not think there should be any difficulty in getting the loan probably your bad credit is haunting you assuming you have bad credit due to any reason whatsoever it should be possible to explain to the potential lender the reasons which led to the problems you may further convince the potential lender that the causes which led to bad credit no longer exist it is a question of putting up your story in a proper way of course the problem can be solved quickly if the lender listens to your story with empathy if this does not work as a stratey you may try high cost loan where the credit rating may not be an issue after repaying some part you can approach a new lender who offers you take over loan facility at a soft rate he will be guided by the latest record of repayment all in all it should not be difficult matter

i agree with the first post that you should tell the truth however you need to put a positive spin on the truth in of the cases you don t want to bad mouth your employer so saying i quit because they were a bunch of losers or they treated me bad or just about anything is a bad idea the big exception would be if you worked for a company that had public ethics problems like enron i think if you worked for enron for example and said i quit because i didn t agree with their accounting practices and i just couldn t keep doing that sort of thing then that would be a pretty good answer because people know enron allegedly did bad things but if you are just saying they did bad things stay away from that strategy if you have other reasons for leaving that might be better but only if they are true i had to move to another city to be nearer my sick mother i wanted to focus on my education anything that shows you didn t just say i m tired of working or i hate my employer in general claiming sexual harassment would also be a red flag unless you won a court case or the company has been sued in the past publically i guess the key is to role reverse and see what you would think if you were interviewing someone and they told your story be brutally honest with yourself if someone said i quit because xyz company are a bunch of losers you would think the person is just a griper or perhaps was not a good worker and was disciplined i quit to take care of my kids well when will you quit again then i didn t like to work so many hours lazy you might mitigate this if you work shifts by saying your personal circumstances made it difficult for you to work the schedule they kept assigning you that assumes you are applying for a job that would be or single shift though if you are an executive or white collar worker one answer could be something like i felt like i had reached a dead end with company xyz they had taken a direction that didn t fit with my career goals and i feel like taking a new job is like getting married you don t want to just jump into something so i wanted to give my new job search my full attention and treat it as a full time job that s why i left probably doesn t work if you are applying to pizza hut though so general advice say it out loud and pretend someone else just told it to you don t try to make excuses or lay blame just put it on the line and while it is ok to spin the truth do tell the truth

an answer would take volumes to provide so let me suggest some literature i would recommend william o neil s the successful investor as a good starting point follow that up with peter lynch s beating the street that should provide you with two strategies that you can learn from in building your own investment strategy other good books include the motley fool investment guide by tom and dave gardner or real money by james cramer i have read all the books above and devised a strategy that adopts a bit from each one another thing you can do is invest using a fictional portfolio let that run for a few months to see if you are ready to take on wall street in the meantime let a professional look after your money ie mutual funds once you are ready sell the fund and invest on your own remember the time spend learning about investing is far less then the money lost by not being prepared good luck

inflation is an increase in the cost of goods and services without a corresponding increase in value if the price of a loaf of bread goes up but the amount and quality of the bread stays the same that is inflation inflation can be caused by more demand than there is supply right now the price of building materials is up because of katrina there is an increased demand for materials and no immediate increase in supply inflation can also be caused by the central federal reserve permitting the supply of money to increase at a rate faster than the increase in the economy an increase in a basic commodity like energy can also cause inflation crude oil is a recent example of this inflation is generally associated with an over heated economy stagflation is usually the combination of inflation and a recession this can occur when the money supply is increased in a effort to get out of a recession but the ecomony remains stagnate

talking is probably the largest factor i can think of when making friends face to face to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc becoming genuinely interested in the other person a somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn t like generally the other person will complain too and you ll have you re conversation you have to be very careful not to do this often because you don t want the other person to think you re a whiner pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written

there is honestly no way to tell for sure intuition is one of the strongest most reliable ways to tell if someone is being honest with you or not but street smarts and common sense play a big part into it yes there eyes are a useful clue the way they dart from the left to the right the way they go when they re talking the way they draw out there voice is another clue pay close attention to the way you react and speak when you re not telling the truth then see if you can find similarities in the way they re talking hands the way people fiddle with items hold them or even push away all of these are subtle clues but mostly pay attention to your gut how do you feel around this person don t tell yourself it s just you feeling how the other person feels because it might be the person making you uncomfortable there smile is a dead give away too see if it s genuine and the way they hold there teeth shut you have to be observant with people to know who they really are it s so hard sometimes to do that without turning out like someone who s staring in the end it s the best to just listen to your emotions the way you feel around them pay attention to what they say but realize it s not always what they say that influences the feeling you get remember their eyes is a big hint also the way they re sitting compare their actions to yours for example if someone shifts in their seat sitting sideways and fiddles with their hands think about how you were feeling and what caused you to sit sideways and fiddle also realize no individual is exactly the same they all feel differently and react differently keep your eyes peeled your heart cautious and your smile friendly want more tips about how to know

sorry don t know of any newspapers that run advertisements for free that is how they make their money you could look up information for each of the newpspers on the internet and contact them directly though link to list of nyc newspapers http dir yahoo com regional u s states new york cities manhattan news and media newspapers
the best route is to go through a nyc ad agency ad agencies usually place those ads you do not have to use them to design the ads just place them i would recommend getting a price from more than one the agencies should receive a discount from the mta for being an agency and some of them may share the savings with you this is really your best bet they know what they are doing and will get you the best combination of price and placement you can go straight to the mta metro transit authority but they will waste a lot of your time and charge you top dollar good luck joetheadguy aol com

i recommend using the andro penis medical traction device to permanently expand the blood carrying chambers the largest being the corpus cavernosa of the penis use the andro penis device hours per day for months you will have time linear flaccid and erect gains in length and some girth gains as well the flaccid gains appear first if you want additional girth gains than what you get with the andro you should use a powerjelq device for minutes a day to supplement it i ve gained permanently length and girth since june through the use of the andro penis and very occassionally powerjelq for exercises i m very pleased with these results try it and you will be happy to see serious gains after months usage there is some information about extenders in general and on proven jelqing techniques on a website called the men s forum in regards to jelqing minutes of powerjelq device equals hours of manual exercise this is a commercial website with a forum and they relabel their extender product size genetics i m not sure if they use the jes extender or the andro however in any case the andro is the best extender product because of the more comfortable silicon band design which is not present on other brand extenders the site forum discusses common issues with the product the most common are how to make wearing the product more comfortable how to effectively secure the product when and how long you can use the product generally the answers to these issues are use the padding band over your glans before putting it in the silicone band use some padding or other material to prevent slippage of the glans out of the band have a rest period every hours at least and massage yourself during that time to ensure good blood flow don t use the device while sleeping you won t have the required massage break every hrs the manual that comes with the andro has adequate information on what to do and what not to do side note about purchasing this item you can usually buy this item on ebay for about the cost of other websites make sure to shop for the best price i paid my package included pills but i never used the pills and i ve still gained girth in months see the link for a study on men using the device it indicates an average growth per month of around cm in length also after six months a median minimum gain of cm also i believe it is helpful to perform pc kegel exercises to strengthen the pc muscle you will be enlarging yourself quite significantly and you want to maintain very strong erection strength and stamina which are controlled by the pubococcyl muscle if you need more information let me know

behavioral interviewing is a relatively new mode of job interviewing employers such as at t and accenture the former andersen consulting have been using behavioral interviewing for about years now and because increasing numbers of employers are using behavior based methods to screen job candidates understanding how to excel in this interview environment is becoming a crucial job hunting skill the premise behind behavioral interviewing is that the most accurate predictor of future performance is past performance in similar situations behavioral interviewing in fact is said to be percent predictive of future on the job behavior while traditional interviewing is only percent predictive behavioral based interviewing is touted as providing a more objective set of facts to make employment decisions than other interviewing methods traditional interview questions ask you general questions such as tell me about yourself the process of behavioral interviewing is much more probing and works very differently in a traditional job interview you can usually get away with telling the interviewer what he or she wants to hear even if you are fudging a bit on the truth even if you are asked situational questions that start out how would you handle xyz situation you have minimal accountability how does the interviewer know after all if you would really react in a given situation the way you say you would in a behavioral interview however it s much more difficult to give responses that are untrue to your character when you start to tell a behavioral story the behavioral interviewer typically will pick it apart to try to get at the specific behavior s the interviewer will probe further for more depth or detail such as what were you thinking at that point or tell me more about your meeting with that person or lead me through your decision process if you ve told a story that s anything but totally honest your response will not hold up through the barrage of probing questions employers use the behavioral interview technique to evaluate a candidate s experiences and behaviors so they can determine the applicant s potential for success the interviewer identifies job related experiences behaviors knowledge skills and abilities that the company has decided are desirable in a particular position for example some of the characteristics that accenture looks for include critical thinking being a self starter willingness to learn willingness to travel self confidence teamwork professionalism the employer then structures very pointed questions to elicit detailed responses aimed at determining if the candidate possesses the desired characteristics questions often not even framed as a question typically start out tell about a time or describe a situation many employers use a rating system to evaluate selected criteria during the interview as a candidate you should be equipped to answer the questions thoroughly obviously you can prepare better for this type of interview if you know which skills that the employer has predetermined to be necessary for the job you seek researching the company and talking to people who work there will enable you to zero in on the kinds of behaviors the company wants in the interview your response needs to be specific and detailed candidates who tell the interviewer about particular situations that relate to each question will be far more effective and successful than those who respond in general terms

do not use ms word it makes flyers that are usually cheesy and pathetic just stay away your best bet outside of hiring a freelance artist to create one for you is to use powerpoint to create it pp gives you a much better sense of layout and balance for the flyer also think hard about the message you want to get across are your prices better than anyone elses is the quality of your work far above your competitors is your work bonded insured if anything should happen you want to motivate the reader to get more information as well as feel confident this is a good lead for them just remember the purpose of a flyer is to get your phones ringing you still have to sell them on using you
if you are getting the phone calls at home then you can contact your phone company and place a block on the number that is calling you if the calls are coming from an anonymous number then you can get anonymous call rejection added to your line so that when a person calls you and blocks their number your phone never rings if you are getting the phone calls on your cell phone then you re not as lucky unlike landline phones cell phone companies don t currently offer anonymous call rejection service if the person that is calling you happens to be blocking their number then there isn t much you can do however if the person that is calling you is not blocking their number then you can just keep your phone from ringing when they call all you have to do is add the person s phone number in your cell phone s address book and then set the custom ring for that person to silent this means that your phone will ring normally for your calls but stay silent when that person you are trying to avoid calls the only downside to this is that the person will still appear in your missed calls log every time they call you

are you asking about a guy liking you or being attracted to you make no mistake about it attracted means that he is aroused by you and wants to have sex with you liking you means that he wants a friendship or perhaps he wants to share with you some sort of emotional or intellectual intimacy these at base are two different and sometimes but not always interdependent issues to put is simply most women usually want both to have sex and intimacy but sometimes she just might want to have a sexual adventure most people men and women in our culture however are not entirely honest with themselves about any this are you if its sex you are craving for showing your bare legs and your painted toenails using cosmetics to make your mouth and lips seem bigger as well as your eyes wider spaced larger and more innocent all that and more work to attract the sexual interest of males period it s just nature but it is also nature for a girl who wants to find a sex mate to maximize her attractiveness and minimize her deficits such as say unshapely legs go for the high heels and the deep plunging neck line or whatever you know what to do you are a girl but are you a woman
well whatever you do don t ask an accountant ask a financial advisor but in general the selling price of a business is usually based on the amount of income or cashflow it generates a buyer will typically pay a multiple of that amount whether that multiple is or times depends a bit on what kind of business it is if it s a great business with high profit margins and is growing at a fast pace and you re selling a product or service that s in high demand a buyer may pay times your earnings or cashflow ex if it generates per year in net income the buyer may pay million for it if it s a much slower growing business or is in any financial distress or is not as attractive than the multiple will obviously be a lot less these multiples may be somewhat arbitrary but keep this in mind buying a business is like any other investment the buyer needs to earn an adequate return on that investment with adequate being a different measure for different people if i require at least a return per year on my investments than i may not pay more than million for your business that generates in income and if there s risk that your business may not last more than a few years than i certainly will not want to pay you more than the total cummulative amount of income it will generate over its remaining life so if your annual income business will only be around for another years than i certainly won t pay more than for it although it will probably be much less than after i adjust for the time value of money all of these factors combined are what go into this decision again it s all a bit arbitrary and there s no exact science for it but hopefully this will at least serve as a guide

you say you ve been trading for five years i assume you ve been trading full capital fully funded positions you can be creative about raising and borrowing more capital by using leveraged financial instruments some of these instruments expose you to the security proce movements while only having to put only or collateral down of course increased leverage means increased risk and increased profits or losses depending on where you are in the world some of these are not legal say cfds are not legal in usa but legal in australia and uk options are an alternative for this instrument in the usa there are also warrants and forex foreign exchange forex forex allows you to put only down collateral i would stay away from margin loans as i feel they are riskier than the aforementioned devices

making a million dollars throughout one s lifetime is not a difficult task anymore it helps to read several books e g automatic millionaire but the real question is do you have the responsibility to spend less than you make and automatically save some every paycheck income doesn t really matter if you can find a way to save month you may not think that it s possible to save year and reach a million dollars but that s the benefit of compound interest there will be a certain point in your savings perhaps after years of constantly saving month in an index mutual fund that gives you a return of or so the interest you make will begin to grow by the hundreds and thousands from that th year on up to your th year the interest will grow so fast that you will have a million dollars the question is did you begin saving when you were years old or when you were years old depending on when you began you d be a millionaire at or at a huge difference of course that could also be changed by saving more per month it s possible but best to read up on lots of books and see the real cost of becoming a millionaire it might be the difference between spending for lunch every day or spending for lunch every day a small sacrifice today can yield huge returns later

your question puzzles me most childhood disabilities cannot be overcome one needs to learn how to overcome the barriers facing children with physical disabilities one cannot overcome muscular dystrophy for example but you can learn how to provide the child with recommended therapies learn about child rights and ada personally i think the most important lesson to learn is how to teach others to include the disabled child in routine activities for example when of pre school age a child with physical disabilities should be able to attend a typical preschool and join in all activities if the pre school is limited then it is they the educators at the preschool in question who need to learn how to include the child children with physical disabilities can live happy well adjusted lives being included in normal activities of life parents of children with disabilities need to be their first and prinmary advocate and learn to speak up for their child until they are able to do so appropriately for themselves

there are multiple answers to your question so i ll give a few examples some take time and other s take more money you can choose what is best for you one way is to just buy a house to live in and hope it appreciates in value over the past years appreciation on real estate has gone through the roof that trend is slowing down though so probably isn t the best solution however owning your own home has very nice tax benefits when filing for your tax return so owning your own home is a very good idea anyway rental property find a multi family home which is generally a regular to oversized house with multiple apartment units in it about to units this is an excellent revenue generator but also comes with some headaches of dealing with tennants if you don t mind investing in lower income areas buying a home in a lower income area and accepting section residents residents using section government help have their rent checks go directly from the government to the landlord can take a lot of stress out of being a landlord considering you never have to haggle over rent the other issue with that is maintaining the property it helps to be handy to keep maintenance costs low therefore increasing your profit the other good thing about that is that lower income areas generally tend to go through a revival at some point where the govt looks to renovate an area by putting a civic use building in the area or just injecting the area with some money such as a sports stadium or office buildings when this happens the value of the properties surrounding it go up which would build equity in your place flip a house flipping is the biggest risk reward situation you never know what you are getting when you buy a house at auction but then again you are getting a piece of property that will turn a big profit when you are done if the project is done right since you can t get in the property or do a thorough search of the structure you don t know what lies in the walls and under the floors you could have some serious damage in the house which is a nightmare to fix the biggest prizes are houses that just need cosmetics done such as new floors bathrooms kitchens some nice paint and some landscaping these can all be done relatively inexpensively compared to structural work and can turn a hefty profit each scenario is different and you have to do what works for you none are easy and they all take patience the easiest one to do is to buy a multi family house and live in it for a year while you rent out the other units a mortgage for a primary residence is the easiest to get and less of a hassle after a year or so move out and rent the unit you lived in and take the money you made saved in that period of time and put it into another house

first i dont suggest wasting much time of the telemarketing from home advertisement you see on the internet most are scams and just want your hard earned start by looking in your local community there are many sales reps finacial planners real estate proffesions that hate cold calling to set up appointments if you are effective at cold calling these proffessionals are looking for people like you an example of one of my clients his call ratio was dials to one appointment now if you allow minutes for each call on average that eguals hours of his time to get one appointment if his goal for an hourly income of say hr that one appointment cost him i set him up with a at home telemarketer which i trained to achieve results of dials to one appointment which he pays per appointment on an average week just working part time this telemarketer is booking appointments earning and my client is doubled his income reduced their stress because they hated cold calling and has become more effective to his clients suggestion to find clients for yourself is as simple as picking up the phone and calling people you know that are in sales also visit your local trade shows where companies set up to gather leads etc that all need to be called another suggestion would be to speak to local business about a developing a marketing approach for their existing customer such as new product announcements events and surveys charging so much per call that is my two cents have a great day

talking is probably the largest factor i can think of to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc becoming genuinely interested in the other person a somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn t like generally the other person will complain too and you ll have you re conversation you have to be very careful not to do this often because you don t want the other person to think you re a whiner there are lots of other ways to start a conversation as well and college is a great place for it keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice ask simple friendly questions about the person also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written fission

speaking as a professional recruiter who has to read s of resumes per day here are some basic points which i hope will be useful to you in compiling a resume use plenty of white space and bulletpoints no block paragraphs please the bulletpoints are a good aid to helping a reader more easily review your resume try not to let your resume go over pages and go for pages if you can as i recruit for information technology professionals i don t care what somebody did over years ago because the technology changes so fast that what happened past years ago is irrelevent by keeping your work history down to years this will also help keep the length of your resume to few pages bear in mind that your resume is a position paper so once you have your basic resume set up when you re responding to particular job ad you want to show verbiage that demonstrates why you are a good fit to a particular position it can be additionally helpful to bold and highlight text in order to grab the reader s attention so while it s good to have a basic resume in place be prepared to revise it accordingly for the position to which you are applying don t just discuss your duties but also try to list any accomplishments that you have obtained while working for past employers examples might include winning an employee award or finishing a project on time and under budget or saving the company s of dollars through any efficiencies that you helped develop during your time with the employer use a reverse chronological format in your work experience listing the most recent employer first and going backwards in time do not use a functional resume because employers want to when and where you did something and a functional resume tends to hide this information i hope this is helpful to you it s obviously not intend to be exhaustive in detail but if you follow these basic principles you ll be on the right track have someone you respect review your resume and add their comments as well good luck

start with ten mil and invest it in the stock market with some luck you ll earn mil which is what i think you meant to ask if you lose you ll still have mil seriously as one who has done what you are looking to do with the success levels you are talking about i have to say that the best way to make a lot of money is to start your own business look at it this way if you work for someone else you can pretty accurately predict what your salary will be over years even optimistically and it will probably be no where near mil so here s the plan start your own business you should do something you like to do set a target for who you are marketing to and what product or service you are providing define that well on paper perhaps you want to provide computer programming services for accounting firms or provide financial planning services for wealthy men m net worth in their s whatever define it well this sets your target customer it guides your efforts every spare moment goes toward building a business for your target finding customers in that arena building a product or service offering in that target range set a financial goal if you want to earn gross m in yrs maybe it looks like this yr k yr k yr k yr k yr k that would put you over m for the total and with a growth rate that would put you over m in yr as well put a plan on paper what does yr look like who are you selling to and what are you selling how many customers do you need how many employees do you need what does a budget look like where would you be spending your money in year to insure that year produces the results that you need it s a given that your plan will be wrong one way or another but it s critical that you do this on paper read the e myth michael gerber lays out a roadmap that was a guide for our multi million dollar start up hire people only if you must and then hire people smarter than you this is critical most start ups go on the cheap most start ups fail look for people that have succeeded in starting a business put your business plan into a presentation and present it to as many influential people as possible amazingly most everyone is supportive of the little guy who has the guts to go out on a limb listen to their advice and weigh it accordingly this is part strategic planning and part marketing you are just trying to get the message out at the end of each presentation ask do you know of anyone who i should talk to who would be interested in my product or service get leads follow up on them keeping your eye on your target market and financial goals turn down very little business down initially until you can meet your financial target price your deals based on how close to the target they are for instance if you choose to perform landscaping for businesses but someone asks you to help them with a residential job bid the job so that it s worth your time don t ever complain that this isn t my core business the only business you want to avoid in the early stages are the deals that don t have a clean exit or a paying customer if you can state your price and do a job and have a satisfied customer and make a few bucks that is golden you are looking for reference accounts when you are so busy that you have the luxury of being selective of the business that you take on price yourself accordingly some business you may want to say no to other business you may want to price high remember the target set in step if it s a bullseye deal exactly the type of business you are looking for with a customer that will be happy and refer

panic attacks are caused when the body s natural triggers for danger become hypersensitised this means that your body will experience a range of sensations eg rapid heart beat high blood pressure sweating shortness of breath chest pain body pain etc and then your brain will interpret these physical sensations as panic even without the presence of any real threat the biggest problem with panic attack is that it can severly hamper a persons life as the sufferer tends to associate things or environments that are present when the attack occurs with the cause of the attack for example if you have one in a supermarket you may decide that you will have to avoid the supermarket in order to avoid the panic attack this can cause hypervigilance which means that you can become so worried about having the next attack that worrying about it becomes worse than having the attack itself cognitive behavioural therapy is very effective in treating panic attacks and involves a number of strategies including relaxation reality testing breath control and exposure therapy in which the therapist recreates the symptoms in a controled environment and over time the patient begins to feel more confident dealing with the physical panic sensations and is then better equipt to mentally interpret them as genuine panic they can then see that is only a sensation that will pass it a few minutes it is important to note that although panic attack symptoms can mimic heart attack no one has ever died becuase of a panic attack

clutch is left pedal brake is middle gas is right pedal first you start the car with your left foot on the clutch and other foot on the brake if it is in neutral without emergency brake on while still keeping the clutch and brake pushed down put the shifter into first then let go of the brake and gently put your right foot on the gas while simultaneously steadily releasing pressure on the clutch with the left foot one foot goes in while the other comes out this is the majority of what makes manual shifting hard to do at first to go to the next gear you want to have high rpm s engine gets loud then you push the clutch back in while letting off the gas a little bit shift to next gear or if you re in if you re in etc and let the clutch back out again while giving it gas back again do it quickly enough so that you don t lose speed and rpm s otherwise you ll bog the engine down when you shift to the higher gear when i mean quickly i don t mean slamming the pedals i mean once you push in the clutch shift quickly then release clutch steadily sometimes if your too slow with that you ll have to get the rpm s back up with the gas pedal slightly or if you re too late you can put it back into the same gear you were in get the speed back up and then match the rpm s of the engine to the speed of the wheels as you re shifting shift up when your engine sounds excessively loud shift down if your engine has no acceleration while pressing on the gas remember pushing the clutch in disengages so pushing it in really fast doesn t do anything other than the engine rpm s going high because of lack of resistance let your foot off gas to prevent that it is letting off the clutch you want to be careful with as it can not only stall the engine but is stressful on the components if you let it off very fast when you want to slow down just let your rpm s lower and do the same thing to shift down if you re slowing down a lot but not going to stop you can skip a couple of gears this takes practice on knowing what speeds which gears run at if you want to come to a complete stop you hold the clutch in while pressing on the brake make sure to put the shifter back into first gear if you re going to go again some people shift down while coming to a stop but this is unnecessary unlessy you re on ice and is just extra footwork if you re not sure if you re going to stop or keep going put it into neutral and coast along until you know whether you re going to stop or continue then put it in the appropriate gear for your speed there have been times where i came to a stop light after i was in rd i held the clutch in until i stopped then i forgot to put it in first before the light changed green i let go of the clutch and it bogged the engine to where it stalled since it was still in rd i then had to restart the engine and put it in first this can be very embarrassing in heavy traffic in slick or icy conditions you want to avoid using your brakes and downshift whithout having to lower the engine s rpms this has a braking effect but it is like anti lock brakes in that your slowing the wheels down by taking their speed and raising the engine from lower rpm s to higher rpm s using the gears it s like if i m in th gear rpm s then i put it in th without touching the breaks the rpm s of the engine are going to rise quickly once i m in th gear this causes a resistance on the wheels but since the engine adjusts to the gears by lowering its rpms from very high it won t lock and cause you to slide everywhere if you re not slowing down fast enough just keep down shifting using the engine as resitance at st gear you should be slow enough to where you can then use your brakes without sliding too much

first know what you really want subtract your own true needs and desires from that which you have been told to want or told you must settle for then use your best thinking to figure where the sort of person who would fit with you is likely to be for example if intelligence is terribly important to you then the academic world is more important than a sports arena or a tv game show audience next go where the people you most want to meet are most likely to be and be a nice person easy to talk to and not pressuring anyone get to know people in the context of your hobbies interests and beliefs instead of a singles type high sexual energy setting be open to adjustments from your ideal maybe it is reasonable for you to want your great love to be very attractive but what you really want is a balance of factors if the person you meet is very compatible otherwise but not as pretty or handsome as you had imagined is that so important or if a man is truly wonderful otherwise but his income is lower than you had hoped weigh factors realistically and realize that you are being evaluated too is it reasonable for people to get hung up in that old joke i met mr right but it didn t work out he was looking for miss right

large companies usually have an hr person coordinating the interview for the hiring manager in such a situation its better to bring up the question with the hr person after the first round of interviews if you are being called back for further interviews then i think this is a good time to bring it up with the recruiter if there is no recruiter involved then in my opinion you should not bring up the compensation question till you get the sense that you are being seriously considered the exception in my mind is that if you are trying to make some decisions choices while interviewing for multiple positions then you can candidly bring it up after your first interview is done

exerpt from an about com hr article these are ten productive ways to deal with your difficult coworker let s start with the first five start out by examining yourself are you sure that the other person is really the problem and that you re not overreacting have you always experienced difficulty with the same type of person or actions does a pattern exist for you in your interaction with coworkers do you recognize that you have hot buttons that are easily pushed we all do you know always start with self examination to determine that the object of your attention really is a difficult person s actions explore what you are experiencing with a trusted friend or colleague brainstorm ways to address the situation when you are the object of an attack or your boss appears to support the dysfunctional actions of a coworker it is often difficult to objectively assess your options anger pain humiliation fear and concern about making the situation worse are legitimate emotions pay attention to the unspoken agreement you create when you solicit another s assistance you are committing to act unless you agree actions will only hurt the situation otherwise you risk becoming a whiner or complainer in the eyes of your colleague approach the person with whom you are having the problem for a private discussion talk to them about what you are experiencing in i messages using i messages is a communication approach that focuses on your experience of the situation rather than on attacking or accusing the other person you can also explain to your coworker the impact of their actions on you be pleasant and agreeable as you talk with the other person they may not be aware of the impact of their words or actions on you they may be learning about their impact on you for the first time or they may have to consider and confront a pattern in their own interaction with people worst case they may know their impact on you and deny it or try to explain it away unfortunately some difficult people just don t care during the discussion attempt to reach agreement about positive and supportive actions going forward follow up after the initial discussion has the behavior changed gotten better or worse determine whether a follow up discussion is needed determine whether a follow up discussion will have any impact decide if you want to continue to confront the difficult person by yourself become a peacemaker decide how badly you want to make peace with the other person and how much you want your current job determine whether you have experienced a pattern of support from your boss if you answer yes to these questions hold another discussion if not escalate and move to the next idea you can confront your difficult coworker s behavior publicly deal with the person with gentle humor or slight sarcasm or make an exaggerated physical gesture no not that one such as a salute or place your hand over your heart to indicate a serious wounding you can also tell the difficult person that you d like them to consider important history in their decision making or similar words expressed positively depending on the subject direct confrontation does work well for some people in some situations i don t think it works to ask the person to stop doing what they re doing publicly but you can employ more positive confrontational tactics their success for you will depend on your ability to pull them off each of us is not spur of the moment funny but if you are you can use the humor well with difficult coworkers if you have done what you can do and employed the first five recommended approaches with little or no success it s time to involve others note that you are escalating the situation prepare to talk with your boss take notes and address the issues not as interpersonal problems but as issues aff

if you re talking about online friends there are lots of communities that can be usefull some sites are xanga myspace hi livejournal imvu and okrut if you see people in real life and just aren t great with becoming friends with them talking is probably the most important thing to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc becoming genuinely interested in the other person keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice ask simple friendly questions about the person also remember that body language is very important people don t realize it but most of the time you ll already have made a lot of judgements about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written fission

if you want a good sound when you are finished i can think of only one way what you need is called a multi track recorder you could search ebay for track or track recorders or studio recorders what such a device will do is split the tape into or sections each of which carries its own information for example track one might carry the drums recording track might have the bass guitar recording track might include your media sample at the proper time etc you get the idea when you have your tracks recorded such a machine will output everything together to a line out jack usually a mini plug like headphones but sometimes a plug you can then record it all to one track of tape cd mp or whatever you can plug it into now studio recorders used to be pretty expensive but as computers have taken over their role in large part you can often find used ones pretty cheap as i suggested try ebay you may also find that a small local recording studio will do the mix for you for a small fee i hope this helps you

breaking into the big leagues of fashion design may be years away but you can still test out some of your ideas in a real world setting i d suggest looking for a local flea market outlet where you can rent your own space on weekends an adult may have to do the actual renting but you can fill it up with your own racks you will have to produce a lot of different designs in popular sizes first which will cost money and time if there are local clothing stores with friendly owners you might be able to get a few feet of display space on a consignment basis this means the owner will put your stuff out for sale and keep a percentage of the sale price instead of charging you for the space this will probably hinge on whether or not the shop owner actually likes your designs and believes they would appeal to his or her customers you definitely need to get into a recognized school of fashion and learn the business side of the industry you might get lucky and have an established designer take you under his or her wing but that sort of thing might happen to a handful of people every year it s better to learn the trade first and then pitch yourself to the right people when you graduate

everyone lies to some degree do you think that when you lied in the past that you had a certain look that everyone could recognize you didn t only the people who knew you really well could tell you were lying like your parents some people present themselves as being honest but almost all the time people find out they aren t it is only when a person gets to know you really well can they tell by your facial expressions and your body language that you are lying there is no look or expression that tells other people you are telling the truth people can tell how honest you are by getting to know you i consider myself a pretty honest person and one of my friends told me i was the most honest person they knew i don t usually lie to people but on the other hand i don t always answer someone when they ask me something personal that i don t want to tell them or i think is none of their business by not telling them i don t think i am lying or being dishonest i am guessing you are a kid when you are a kid the consequences of your lying are usually being kept in your room not getting a toy but that depends on what you lied about if you become an adult who lies it could lead to much more serious consequences and once again it depends on what you lie about you could lose a job for lying lose your best friend i hope you continue working on being honest that is a good character trait to have hope i helped you understand

with years experience in the mortgage business i have never seen a student loan that was in repayment treated any differently than any other long term debt while you may be able to ask for a hardship deferal in the future which is the only advantage on a student loan that doesn t exist on a standard installment loan no lender wants to anticipate that circumstance as long as the payments extend past months in the future the lender will only use your monthly payment as part of your qualifying ratios the total debt is not that important and would only be a minor factor what will matter more is your payment history on the student loan it should be perfect it all comes down to the quality of your credit history your fico score and your qualifying ratios of debt income

most if not all of those kinds of applications have been researched and explained in at least superficial ways the russians studied a lot the concepts of esp telepathy psychokinesis and other phenomena especially or decades ago they concluded that it was possible to for example wake people up by hypnotic suggestion when the person might have been miles away and under these experiments the persons would wake up seconds after the hypnotic suggestions were made these experiments were carried out with the purpose of setting up examples that would clearly show that hypnothic telepathy or remote influencing was possible now if hypnosis is used to bring about changes in a person s behavior by letting them understand things in new ways clinical hypnosis at least i can see how carefully designed techniques could help a person develop these kinds of skills in real life a hypnotist could supress and restructure a client s map of the world in such a way where his psychic skills can fluorish better such practices are not very much practiced today at least and usually private research or government research are the only ones that do so but a person who is skilled at hypnosis can understand that hypnosis is a whole theory of communication and that deep trance is not neccessary for hypnosis hypnosis is about influence and persuasion and as such people can practice and communicate with it in their everyday lives in their everyday lives they can practice erotic types of hypnosis for example making their outcomes all the more enjoyable if you want to know more about hypnosis i suggest you carefully study more may i suggest a good source

if a person is in need of a furniture sometimes people that just bought new furniture will leave their old furniture near the road for the trash pick up to pick up so you can walk around and see if anybody is throwing any furniture away and if you see something that you may need go get your truck and pick it up and take it home one time we sat out a microwave that was fried we were cooking something and the microwave started sparking like too much electricity was going through it you know when you have a v device and you try to run v into it what happens you are right too much electricity goes through it and burns it up we sat that out near the trash along with a inch computer monitor that did not work and someone came by and picked them up i m glad that person could use those things i don t know what that person will use them for maybe he knew somebody that recycled electronics and would give him like for all that stuff you could also look in garbage cans and garbage dumpsters sometimes people throw good stuff away i once knew a person that found a baby doll missing one eye i m sure that could be easily fixed if you are a smoker instead of buying your own cigarettes you could try bumming how bumming a cigarette works is you go up to someone smoking and say look really desperate and tired could i bum a cigarette off you act like you are using your last bit of oxygen talking to the person if you don t like to bum then you could look in ashtrays for cigarettes most people won t finish a cigarette they take a some puffs and put it out leaving a pretty good length to smoke my ideas of getting stuff for free gillette sent me a brand new razor about years ago i still use it to this day so you might try writing to gillette and asking them if they would send you a free razor make the letter sound like you really want to support them trojan gives away free condoms to young people to show that they care about preventing youth pregnancies so you might want to write them and ask them for some condoms if you drink a lot of sodas say pepsi save up your receipts and send a letter along with the receipts asking if they would send you some coupons or give you a free case of soda since you support them so heavily i think baseball stadiums gives tickets away these tickets won t give you good seats you might need binoculars to enjoy the game i don t think the free seats will provide view of the big screen because you will be way up in the air right underneath the roof so that roof might block your view a little bit oh and i don t think the food vendor person is going to walk all the way up there just to give you a hotdog and drink they serve only people closest to the field

i am the founder and owner of a national staffing company so i do speak with some insights into this area as we face it all the time generally staffing firms quote the price to their client for a contract after they know what they need to pay their contractor employee you it is therefore difficult to ask for a raise if you have just been put on a contract assignment that being said if the contract with the client you are working for is a long one year or longer then you should simply let your agency employer know that you need a raise if your contact with the client is coming up for a renewal the time for asking for a raise is before you agree to be extended at the same client your employer may be able to negotiate a higher rate with their client to cover your raise if you have recently rolled off one client and are about to start a new assignment tell your employer that you need a higher rate if you are put on an assignment and you suddenly are being asked to do much more than what you were originally sent to the client to do it is acceptable to request a raise whatever you do do not be silent let your staffing agency employer know that you seek a raise they will not get mad as they need you the worst that can happen is that they say no but if they are asking you to start a new contract or they are asking you to extend your contract at an existing client then you do have a good deal of leverage and should be able to negotiate some raise as they need you for the client assignment

hiccups are involuntary spams of the diaphragm you should drink lots of water and try to force a really big yawn or two it seems to force the diaphragm to relax which can help stop hiccups you can also push below the rib cage for about seconds or try to hold your breath as best as you can i once heard about drinking water while leaning over and from the other side of the rim when you hold the glass but that just sounds silly to me many others i have known swear by this method though another good remedy is to shake a few dashes of angostura bitters on a lime wedge and suck it for just a few seconds it s amazing i ve seen it work every time the bitters can be found in most markets in the liquor section it does not contain any alcohol it stops them instantaneously i have also heard that a good fright will do it if somebody scares you unexpectedly not a scary movie like lunging out at you and yelling boo it works but only if you re not expecting it good luck

you have to make mold and afterward a cast so you can pour the mixture of resin until it hardens you can try by making a figure of airplanes or ships in modelling clay if the figure is necessarily bigger than one foot you should make a sturdy paper sculpture out of wires and old newspapers like a papier mache and then afterwards add modelling clay on its surface roughly inches thick but this is just for your mold and then you have to cast this finished mold figure in plaster of paris so you have a cast of the figure cut in to two proportions right in the equilateral middle before you can actually use the resin remove the mold or the paper mache with molded clay and leave the plaster cast empty before using the resin mixture also apply a separating medium on the inside of the plaster cast like petroleum jelly or floorwax before using the resin chemical on its surface be careful with resin it is toxic use knitted gloves and mask for protection resin pour must be even in the cast so use resin fiber to make it even and so breaking of the resin would be avoided wait til the resin dries up and hardened after you have done doing this break the plaster cast so u can see the hardened resin figure from it then connect the pieces of resin cast together because u have made equilateral cuts so u can achieve a whole figure of the ship or airplane good luck

well being an entreprenuer is hard sometimes but i did it i did it all on my own through trial and error theres alot of psychology involved this is mainly because you are trying to think how a mass of customers think and how an individual customer thinks you dont need a business idea you can just take ideas from existing businesses but you will need alot of business skills this is all you need to become an entreprenuer its really the basics of being able to write a business plan from start to finish including exit strategies when you can do this for many different types of businesses then you can say you are an entreprenuer but if you are stuck on some part of a particular business i suggest you best understand it and learn why it is so because i can hypothesize about almost any business and its alot of make up scenarios and alot of hitting and dodging objects and obstacles but once you are at that level then you can start opening businesses start with the businesses you see and then slowly move and try to create a unique business as your own i have many businesses available but you would need to work at them since these businesses are original and maybe never been tried in my area i personally opened a painting businesses rare coin business business consulting business and a college essay business not all of them are in gear now but then again i dont think i need to do like jobs at a time currently i am a gold smith in my spare time i buy used jewelry and refurbish them then i resell them you can ponder on these ideas for a while i have some business available for a fee

damn girl you ask some tough questions weather it counts or not here is my view on this one you don t like sex hmmmmmmm have you tried making love instead the art of making love consists of two people in love coming together in a sexual act not liking sex can only suggest that you do not have any feelings for the other person participating within the sex for most men a relationship revolves around sex if he don t get it you don t get him that may sound harsh but unfortunately it s the truth if you are with a man that you truly love i m sure the results will be different now i can t be serious all the time so i m going to end this answer with a joke please don t take offence at it it s just a joke those who think sex is a pain in the arse are usually getting it in the wrong hole

the capitalization rate or cap rate is a ratio used to estimate the value of income producing properties put simply the cap rate is the net operating income divided by the sales price or value of a property expressed as a percentage investors lenders and appraisers use the cap rate to estimate the purchase price for different types of income producing properties a market cap rate is determined by evaluating the financial data of similar properties which have recently sold in a specific market it provides a more reliable estimate of value than a market gross rent multiplier since the cap rate calculation utilizes more of a property s financial detail the grm calculation only considers a property s selling price and gross rents the cap rate calculation incorporates a property s selling price gross rents non rental income vacancy amount and operating expenses thus providing a more reliable estimate of value if we have a seller and an interested buyer for particular piece of income property the seller is trying to get the highest price for the property or sell at the lowest cap rate possible the buyer is trying to purchase the property at the lowest price possible which translates into a higher cap rate the lower the selling price the higher the cap rate the higher the selling price the lower the cap rate in summary from an investor s or buyer s perspective the higher the cap rate the better investors expect a larger return when investing in high risk income properties the cap rate may vary in different areas of a city for many reasons such as desirability of location level of crime and general condition of an area you would expect lower capitalization rates in newer or more desirable areas of a city and higher cap rates in less desirable areas to compensate for the added risk in a real estate market where net operating incomes are increasing and cap rates are declining over time for a given type of investment property such as office buildings values will be generally increasing if net operating incomes are decreasing and capitalization rates are increasing over time in a given market place property values will be declining if you would like to find out what the cap rate is for a particular type of property in a given market place check with an appraiser or lender in that area be aware that the frequency of sales for commercial income properties in a given market place may be low and reliable capitalization rate data may not be available if you are able to obtain a market cap rate from an appraiser or lender for the type of property you are evaluating check to see if the cap rate value was determined with recent sales of comparable properties or if it was constructed when adequate financial data is unavailable appraisers may construct a cap rate through analysis of its component parts thus reducing the credibility of the results cap rates which are determined by evaluating the recent actions of buyers and sellers in a particular market place will produce the best market value estimate for a property if you are able to obtain a market cap rate you can then use this information to estimate what similar income properties should sell for this will help you to gauge whether or not the asking price for a particular piece of property is over or under priced noi noi cap rate estimated value

first you have to be clear in your own my why you are quitting there may be several reasons now which reason is the one that should live on in your employee folder to be referenced the next time you need to write an application for a job or a claim for unemployment for that one is it necessary to use a euphemism for example you don t want to say because my supervisor was a karat b h but personality conflict with supervisor even that is not a great reason but at least it is not a lie if there are other reasons which will not torpedo you with the next job use them for example needed to spend more time with my children is excellent if the next job is part time or if you are going to stay home for a substantial period now always express regret however hypocritical face it even a job you hate can be regretted because one of the people you worked with was nice or the benefits were good or whatever it is not necessary to state the reason for your regret but the basic line is i regret to inform you that i am tendering my resignation effective july the date should be at least two weeks if you can or if there is a compelling reason why substitute effective immediately that will need to be explained in the next sentence so the reason had better be because your mother is dying and you have moved her into your house so you can take care of her full time or something equally compelling and urgent sometimes the resignation is requested it is offered to you to tender your resignation to avoid being fired if you accept such a proposal make no mention of it in the letter just say for personal reasons or for reasons of health and let it go at that you must always assume that your letter of resignation may be seen by someone else some day and assume that the circumstances are unfavorable to yourself when you write your letter make it no longer than it needs to be a sentence or two at most and sign it sincerely or yours truly whichever is the standard at your company for letters do not put any of the hostility you may feel in your letter and if the regret is sincere it does not need to be profuse i sincerely regret rather than simply i regret is enough to make the point

true love it s as mysterious as the stars it was written on as elusive it is everything it s hyped about to be it s worth taking every risk it s worth fighting for and the problem is if you don t risk all then you risk even more love is kind of an elixir that lures us out of reality and into the realm of fantasy it s like a drug creating an altered state of consciousness love is the moment when an unfavorable act becomes favorable when you make excuses for some one else s mistakes when you learn to tolerate when you learn acceptance when sacrificing becomes the beauty of life it s the courage to tell the truth especially when you believe its unspeakable it s the time when seeing some one being seen by some one and thinking about some one feels good when you learn to find happiness in the smallest of moments that s love when you learn to put down your ego and love some one more than that love is forgetting your self and remembering some one else love is choosing your partner exactly as he is and supporting him in his choices it s honoring your partner s truth and wanting best for him it s not controlling or possessing but rather respecting and trusting it does not mean owning some one getting some one rather it means being happy in your loved one s happiness love means living without judgments it means treasuring your beloved and never taking him for granted love means being able to forgive and learning to give more then you get it means reaching out when you don t want to communicating rather than assuming and asking questions rather than jumping to conclusions it means working things out rather than fighting fighting rather than leaving and staying through the hurts and disappointments knowing that through commitment all can be healed falling in love is like being enveloped in a magical cloud the air feels fresher the flowers smell sweeter food tastes more delectable and the stars shine more brightly at night you feel light and lofty as though you are floating through life and your problems and challenges suddenly seem insignificant and easily surmountable your body feels alive your skin tingles and you awaken in the morning with a smile on your face you are suspended in a state of supreme delight love is a feeling and an action that arises from the most primal place within us making a relationship however is a process that is learned a relationship is the vessel that carries the precious cargo of love through time relationships are like a precious antique lamp it takes a little polish and some effort to restore it to its valuable condition a relationships love and luster will only improve with age if you continually give it the care that keeps it beautiful but once you uncover its essential beauty it will bring you joy for years to come after having said all this i want to say that you have to make the decision on your own on one hand love is magic on the other it s time tested relationship worked hard and furiously at

the stock market and investment another look at the micro foundations of q theory abstract this paper introduces a novel distinction between real q and financial q the paper examines three versions of financial q developed by brainard and tobin minsky and hayashi these theories differ regarding the nature of stock market price determination and their use of marginal productivity theory it is shown that non profit maximizing behavior by managers does not invalidate q theory it is also shown that if managers and shareholders have different profit expectations this leads to an equilibrium value of q that differs from unity lastly the implicit claims in q theory regarding the efficient role of stock markets as regulators of capital accumulation are shown to depend on assumptions about stockholder behavior jel ref e keywords q theory stock markets investment arbitrage cost of equity capital profit maximization revised august forthcoming cambridge journal of economics thomas i palley assistant director of public policy afl cio sixteenth street nw washington dc i the implications of stock market q for policy the monetary transmission mechanism remains an enduring area of interest in monetary macroeconomics macroeconomic models have traditionally emphasized the interest rate channel which affects investment spending by establishing a hurdle rate of return for the marginal efficiency of investment however this traditional channel has been replaced increasingly by brainard and tobin s q theory of investment their approach emphasizes equity prices and shifts attention away from the bond and money markets toward equity markets in place of interest rates equity prices become the main channel whereby monetary policy affects investment spending blanchard the q approach to the transmission mechanism increases the macroeconomic significance of stock markets which now take on an important role in managing the process of capital accumulation this argument has taken on heightened policy significance owing to the debate over privatization of state funded old age pension schemes privatization would likely increase saving in the form of equities thereby increasing equity prices and q if q theory holds this would raise investment spending and capital accumulation thereby helping address the problem of supporting an aged population a second reason why q theory has taken on increased policy significance is the shift within the u s to budget surplus fiscal conservatives argue that a reduced national debt will increase investment because reduced supplies of debt will lower interest rates and have a portfolio knock both q and the conventional keynesian interest rate mechanism share a reliance on asset market price signals as the means for affecting real economic activity this contrasts with theories emphasizing quantity effects such as the credit rationing approach stiglitz and weiss in addition to affecting investment spending through q equity prices also affect consumption spending through their impact on household wealth this wealth effect is separable and distinct on effect that raises equity prices and q finally a third policy development concerns the fostering of equity markets in developing countries if q matters for investment then developing countries should be encouraged to promote local stock markets and this provides a justification for privatization in order to create widespread equity ownership for all of the above reasons q theory of investment has taken on greater policy significance this paper analyzes the theoretical foundations of q s claimed link between equity markets and investment spending it clarifies the differences between alternative constructions of q and shows that these rest on i different interpretations of the efficiency of stock m

the first and most important thing is to get a consistent paying job and start paying down any debt you have as quickly as possible one primary debt to pay off first is credit card debt which is because of the incredibly high interest rates sometimes a year if you have student loans you should consolidate those to lock in a lower interest rate and opt for the longest payback term possible years maybe because the interest to pay back is relatively low roughly or so depending on the loan if you have other debt car loans etc then you should pay those back nd rd th and then the minimum student loans possible also on new credit card charges you should pay the entire new charge balance in addition to paying off your current debt to make sure you don t spend more than you make and to make sure you re not shooting yourself in the foot creating more debt and not paying it off will hurt your credit score overall if you are a super spender this is going to take a lot of patience and discipline on your part and after a few years of doing this your credit score hopefully will be significantly higher good luck i know you can do it

these tips should help get you through the beard growing process more may be added later consider starting your beard while on vacation you ll be more relaxed about it while away from your job don t be overly concerned about other people s potential reactions to your new beard if you have a good beard most people will probably react favorably possibly much more favorably than you would have ever anticipated so relax and enjoy the experience when starting to let your beard grow just stop shaving completely do not shave at all for at least the first four weeks of growth one of the most common errors is to attempt to start shaping or sculpting the beard too early in the process even if you are just planning to grow a van dyke or goatee you should let everything grow for the first four weeks why let your beard grow for four weeks before you start to shape it even if you are just growing a goatee if you don t wait you might cut off more than you really wanted also you might not have thought about going for the striking effect of an oversized goatee such as the one seen here you can always trim it down to a smaller size later after four weeks you can start shaping the beard usually you ll want to define a neck line along the bottom of your beard around the neck this is probably best done by a professional barber or stylist the hard part may be finding one who has a lot of experience in beard styling generally the cheek line the upper limit of the beard on the cheeks is best left natural some men butcher otherwise excellent beards by shaving the cheeks into strange shapes unless your beard appears to be starting just below your eyes you probably are better off not shaving or sculpting the beard on your cheeks invest in a beard trimmer and learn how to use it usually you should shampoo your beard with the same shampoo you already use for your head pat your beard gently dry with a towel blow drying is not usually necessary and is probably not recommended anyway don t let itching deter you if you experience itching keep your skin clean by daily shampooing with a gentle shampoo and optionally using a conditioner your skin will eventually adjust to the new situation itching should be only a temporary phase don t give up it may help to set a target date for example give yourself a minimum of six weeks growth before deciding to abandon your beard growing effort commit to not shaving before that six weeks is up when you ve reached the six weeks date then you can decide whether you want to continue with the beard or get rid of it if you choose to get rid of your new beard the easiest way to dispose of it is to use a beard trimmer or other hair clippers use the trimmer or clippers to trim away as much hair as possible follow that with a regular shave be extra careful for more reading refer the link http www thehappyguy com beard html

real bad credit comes from loans or other agreements to pay that were not handled well by the borrower a lender being asked to loan money to the person with real bad credit is well aware that this person hasn t been diligent in paying as agreed generally that rules out a lot of options because many traditional lenders aren t willing to take on the risk if you have assets home equity paid for car that can serve as assurance against the loan you can usually find someone who will make the loan but at higher than normal interest rates if the credit is bad enough it may require extra ordinary surety such as a title loan where they get your car if you don t repay pretty much all options are bad options when someone wants to borrow money but has bad credit a better option might be to begin to get a better handle on their personal finances and generally going further into debt isn t the best direction good luck

talking is probably the largest factor i can think of if you are around people but don t really know them or are shy and unsure how to become friends with them to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc becoming genuinely interested in the other person a somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn t like generally the other person will complain too and you ll have you re conversation you have to be very careful not to do this often because you don t want the other person to think you re a whiner there are lots of other ways to start a conversation as well and college is a great place for it keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice ask simple friendly questions about the person also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written the internet has a lot of free sites where you can meet and talk to other people online much of the advice can be altered to fit im

you need to work on the internal dialogue with yourself i would assume from your comments that you are very negative with yourself probably always feeling that you will look stupid unintelligent or weird but the facts are always different than that you must start praising yourself internally on a daily basis replace that negative thinking by constantly telling yourself and reassuring yourself that you are smart freindly confident etc talk positively to yourself everyday and all the time you have to replace that insecurity that has built up over the years with new thoughts and feelings it will take time yes but it is possible and you will be able to eventually feel more comfortable in your own skin be bold and take new steps even if you feel nervous about it the best way to make progress is to jump in and do what you don t want to do you will never grow if you don t directly face your fears and once you break new ground in one area it will always be easier to come back and do it again because you have already been through it rid yourself of negativity and replace it with constant internal praise give yourself pats on the back when you feel you have done something positive or valuable in your eyes god gave you unique gifts and a unique personality so that you can share it with others don t rip others and yourself off by not sharing your great unique personality you can do it never give up on being who you want to be god bless

when a company goes public which is a long complicated and very expensive process its equity or a portion of it is granted to the public at large to be traded freely an underwriter usually an investment banker packages the deal and seeks investors to buy the new issue the charge a lot for this and usually keep some of the equity for themselves you will have to give up your position companies will sell up to of themselves in their ipo but usually less than that the company will have a valuation that is a very thorough examination of its worth by financial analysts once a value is reached the underwriter will seek buyers for that value on the street the sec and state securities enforcement will have to be satisfied the numbers make sense and the officers and directors of the company are legitimate and pose no threat to the investing public this is not easy you can do this in a small scale with a sb filing with the sec and there are exemptions under regulation d for small sales of equities and debt your pay off comes from the value of the stock you still holding going up and the company benefits because the underwriter usually guarantees a certain dollar amount the valuation for the stock it sells once the stock begins to float on the market however the company does not get more cash only the investors if it appreciates

good is a term that will always be subject to interpretation but if you want to be scientific about it take a large simple random sample of men in your community blindfold them so that their decision is not affected by your looks then proceed to kiss each one and afterwards the men can vote on a scale of how good the kiss was as with any scientific experiment you will need repetition to give validity to your results after performing this test take the average of all the men s votes and if you score over i would say you are probably a good kisser if you are a man you could do the same thing with women or to be even more general about it just sample men and women together it would be interesting to see their results especially since they wouldn t actually know what gender they were kissing you could compare gender age groups social status etc to see what types of people go for your wet ones

criminal records are public if you mean sealing as to not allow members of the public to have access then you are fighting a losing battle if you mean to expunge your record to make it disapear then the best way is to hire an attorney or go back to your public defender depending on the nature of the record it is just a matter of paperwork and money of course to have your record expunged you have to show the courts that you have kept your nose clean for over a lenght of time in most cases many years you also have to remember that the prosecutor most likely will not want your record cleared remember he she was elected into office to put criminals in jail each court has its filling fees for most part the request has to be in proper form submitted and all fees paid it is a very simple process very little paperwork involved but like i said the best way is to just hire an attorney he she can best argue your case to give you a ball park figure the court jurisdiction in which i worked the filling fee was bucks and an attorney would charge around bucks these vary by jurisdiction and state good luck remember having your record sealed will still show a hit on ncic you will still be considered open game an expunged record on the other hand will show no hits on ncic agian good luck

first of all it is doubtful anyone can be taken seriously enough to make serious money without good english if english is not your native language and you do not plan to practice in an english speaking country this is probably not the right web site for you anyway the way to make real money at anything is to do what you love so that you will do it very well and probably spend longer hours than someone for whom it is just a paycheck so do you love architecture if i were going into this field today i might be very tempted to go into restoration and rebuilding rather than new building design the trick would be to develop or perhaps purchase a computer program that you could input the measured information about the building as it currently exists whatever information you have about what it was like when it was new together with whatever is necessary to comply with current codes and produce a plan for the owner that would make the building as close to the original as possible within those restrictions it would take a lot of research into old fashioned designs and materials and a lot of creativity to imitate the old components in modern materials when necessary but i think it would be fascinating and very lucrative if such a thing had been available in california at the time of the earthquake we might still have our beloved cooper house in santa cruz this was especially tragic because it had just recently been restored and so the plans for that restoration might still have been in existence good luck whatever you decide to do

diapers may be made of absorbent layers of cloth or terry towelling fabric or of disposable absorbent materials the choice to use either cloth or disposable diapers is controversial while cloth diapers are certainly cheaper than disposables over time environmental impact health and convenience also play a role in the decision however all of the studies which started the controversy in the early s were funded by procter gamble which manufactures the vast majority of disposable diapers and was facing growing criticism at that time cloth cloth diapers are washable and reusable and place less stress on landfills to clean them people use laundry detergent and water users of top loading washers may use us gallons m of water in a year period whereas users of front loading machines may use us gallons m cloth diaper wearing children tend to toilet train earlier because the cloth retains moisture which allows the child to feel when he or she is wet and or dirty and associate the feeling with elimination cloth diaper wearing children go through about diaper changes if thrown into a landfill cotton diapers decompose within six months cloth diapers have become more user friendly in recent years pre formed cloth diapers with snaps or velcro and all in one diapers with wet proofed exteriors are now available in addition to the older pre fold and pin variety increasingly popular are pocket or stuffable diapers which consist of a water resistant outer shell sewn on three sides to a stay dry liner pocket diapers are stuffed with a folded absorbent towel some find pocket diapers to combine the ease of use of an all in one with the rinsability and quick drying of a flat some cities offer a cloth diapering service which delivers clean diapers and picks up soiled ones for a fee cloth diapers may be used in conjunction with elimination communication as a back up in case of an accident incontinent persons able to change their own diapers and caregivers of incontinent persons who cannot often find that cloth diapers are more cost effective and comfortable when in the home disposable modern disposable diapers are generally made of a cloth like waterproof exterior a moisture wicking inside layer and an absorbent inner core in modern diapers usually a dried hydrogel the first mention of the disposable diaper was made by paulistrom in sweden in the early disposable diapers had an inner of many layers of tissue paper and were able to hold cc of urine which is approximately one wetting in the s a pulp mill was used for the absorbent core and the disposable diaper became much more popular for the families who could afford them disposable diapers have overtaken the cloth diaper market and put many diaper services out of business due to their convenience and relatively small bulk on the baby approximately billion units of disposable diapers were sold in the us in disposable diapers take a great deal of processing and their materials remain intact in landfills for many years some reports estimate years because disposable diapers wick moisture away from the child s body children tend not to realize they are wet which may be the reason that disposable diaper wearing children toilet train after the age of three as a result these children may require disposable diapers before they are toilet trained the result is that while a cloth diaper costs more per unit a disposable diaper will cost considerably more over time as a cloth diaper can be laundered and re used whereas a disposable cannot disposable diapers are laced with chemicals obtained unintentionally in production as well as intentionally in order to improve absorbancy and pull wetness away from the skin while this system works well in keeping skin dry it also provides a potential skin irritant

as one who has done what you are looking to do with the success levels you are talking about i have to say that the best way to make a lot of money is to start your own business look at it this way if you work for someone else you can pretty accurately predict what your salary will be over years even optimistically and it will probably be no where near mil so here s the plan start your own business you should do something you like to do set a target for who you are marketing to and what product or service you are providing define that well on paper perhaps you want to provide computer programming services for accounting firms or provide financial planning services for wealthy men m net worth in their s whatever define it well this sets your target customer it guides your efforts every spare moment goes toward building a business for your target finding customers in that arena building a product or service offering in that target range set a financial goal if you want to earn gross m in yrs maybe it looks like this yr k yr k yr k yr k yr k that would put you over m for the total and with a growth rate that would put you over m in yr as well put a plan on paper what does yr look like who are you selling to and what are you selling how many customers do you need how many employees do you need what does a budget look like where would you be spending your money in year to insure that year produces the results that you need it s a given that your plan will be wrong one way or another but it s critical that you do this on paper read the e myth michael gerber lays out a roadmap that was a guide for our multi million dollar start up hire people only if you must and then hire people smarter than you this is critical most start ups go on the cheap most start ups fail look for people that have succeeded in starting a business put your business plan into a presentation and present it to as many influential people as possible amazingly most everyone is supportive of the little guy who has the guts to go out on a limb listen to their advice and weigh it accordingly this is part strategic planning and part marketing you are just trying to get the message out at the end of each presentation ask do you know of anyone who i should talk to who would be interested in my product or service get leads follow up on them keeping your eye on your target market and financial goals turn down very little business down initially until you can meet your financial target price your deals based on how close to the target they are for instance if you choose to perform landscaping for businesses but someone asks you to help them with a residential job bid the job so that it s worth your time don t ever complain that this isn t my core business the only business you want to avoid in the early stages are the deals that don t have a clean exit or a paying customer if you can state your price and do a job and have a satisfied customer and make a few bucks that is golden you are looking for reference accounts when you are so busy that you have the luxury of being selective of the business that you take on price yourself accordingly some business you may want to say no to other business you may want to price high remember the target set in step if it s a bullseye deal exactly the type of business you are looking for with a customer that will be happy and reference able price it to win the business if it s far from the bullseye then raise your price or don t bid on it every once in a while look at your portfolio of deals and see which ones are close to the target and how far afield you ar

the other gentleman is correct the best way to make money is to own your own business but i would add a distinction to his comment about making something out of nothing and having it be used by millions of people instead of making something out of nothing you can rearrange existing and cheap objects or components or free applications www odeo com blogger com bloglet com etc into a business model that generates value for millions of people in other words i think getting rich today has more to do with using your imagination to create new value from readily available products and not creating new products in fact it was the co founder of firefox who said that the next big thing is whatever makes the last big thing usable the key question is how to create something that millions of people can use the founders of yahoo asked themselves precisely that question they asked how can we constructively alter the daily experience of millions of people

there are a few popular atm manufacturers dibold and ncr come to mind i seem to remember a price of around but of course physical structure can alter that price a lot will it be inside but i think the right way to go about this is to work with a local bank or credit union what you ll need to do is convince one of them that this location will generate enough traffic to justify the cost or tell them that you will subsidize the cost maybe you can reduce or eliminate the risk for them by promising a certain volume of transactions banks and credit unions are always looking for choice spots for atms in fact they may pay you rent for the space get a map of the atms around you and see who does not have a presence in that area maybe you can find a mid sized bank who would be willing to expand their atm network and put one in and maybe you can make a few bucks on the rent the banks and credit unions are pros at deploying atms so don t try to figure it out yourself instead try to figure out who needs you the most and work with them just a thought good luck

well you re kind of comparing apples and oranges first the easy answer memory cards do not have to be compatible with anything except the device they are used in buy whatever your camera can read write to a pixel is a display element think of your computer screen as made up of thousands of tiny squares each square is one color the more squares you have the smaller they are and the more detail you can get in the picture on your screen the reason this matters in cameras is that the more megapixels your camera can use the more detail it can include in your picture the effect on memory is that the more megapixels and the higher the quality you set on the camera the fewer pictures you can fit on a memory card so the more memory you buy the more pictures you can take before you have to download to your computer and clear the card buy the biggest you can afford memory costs go up by size if you have more questions or if this answer isn t clear just update your question and i ll update my answer

one thing you should know a business online is just like any other business it will take time and work to succeed i work online as well and make a nice side income i can tell you that i am only where i am now because i asked questions and actually acted on advice i was given too many times people expect an online business to make them money within a month and without much work it is not like that very often i just wanted to clear that all up first ebay is a great way to start make sure your products are not all over ebay though and if they are make sure to add something to your offer make it different from all the others if you can one thing you can do that has helped me is to write and submit articles to article directory sites write about your site write about what you know and at the end of the article include a url to your web site once finished writing it make sure it s not just a sales letter but good information submit it to article directories so other users can use the article on their site if everything goes well you will start receiving some web traffic from those articles but again it will take a month or two and a few good articles to see any traffic but this is a free method of advertising however paying to advertise will general get you more traffic faster and probably more sales faster as well you can use yahoo s overture pay per click to advertise your site you pay yahoo a bit of money for each person who clicks on your ad within yahoo it will cost money but if your site is good you should make some sales i do this with yahoo and other sites as well making an online business profit is hard work at times and there are a lot of ebooks out there that can help i have only gotten into a bit about it one thing you can do is to visit online business forums where you can ask questions and get feedback from other successful online business people

i love the easy questions all you have to do is send the debt collector a letter requesting that he validate the debt that means he has to prove that you actually owe the debt by supplying copies of contracts receipts bills and or any records that pertain to how the debt was created and calculated in many cases i have counseled this will usually stop everything immediately and you may even get a letter affirming you do not owe a debt where many people make their mistake is asking the collector to verify the debt all they need to do in this case is contact the original debtor and ask if it s a legitimate debt if they say yes it s now verified that does you no good at all that is all that s required of credit bureaus too which makes it hard to get reports taken off your records ok now my battle cry you are about to go to war do not fight these guys unarmed your only weapon is knowledge so read the links i have supplied below and studly the fair debt collections act your enemy is already armed with this information now you will be fighting them on equal grounds they have days to respond with all of this information if they do not respond or do not provide sufficient proof then contact the credit reporting agencies demanding they remove the listing if one exists also be sure to send them a cease and desist letter demanding that they do not contact you by phone again if they do you have legal grounds to go after them

if you are having any bad feelings about having sex do not have sex sex is not supposed to give you bad feelings about your boyfriend yourself or relationship these bad feelings simply mean you are not ready tell your boyfriend that you are not ready and are not going to have sex don t do something just because he asked you do do it especially sex it s not like he s asking you to carry his books or pick out his socks if you do something you are not ready for you will live with regret and that will be alot harder to live with than the fact that you hurt his feelings don t do anything you are not ready for good luck
the only obvious answer is he was killed according to tom grant courtney love s pi who was hired after cobain dissapeared from rehab cobain had an extremely high heroin level at the time of his death grant says that there is no way he could have rolled down his sleeve put away the heroin and then shot himself with that much in his system grant thinks the heroin was used to incapacitate cobain before whoever shot him there was also a suicide note found at the scene which grant believes was actually a note saying he was done with the music industry courtney love filmaker nick broomfield claims that el duce bandleader of the mentors admitted that love offered him to kill cobain days later el duce mysteriously died leaving broomfield without enough evidence for his case it is believed that cobain s killer also killed el duce el duce was hit by a train but it is believed he was actaully pushed onto the tracks to silence him who ever it was might have been very close to love cobain had a young daughter who he said was the greatest thing in his life and considering the rough relationship i do not think he would have left his daughter with love around the time of his death courtney love threatend to leave cobain and get custody of frances bean his daughter she cited his heroin use as the reason despite the fact she was a bigger druggie than he was maybe she realized she would never get custody of frances without killing cobain also cobain was found above in the spare room above the garage but his body was not found for days if courtney was really looking for him she would have found his body sooner unless she didn t want to sadly this case like the tupac shakur case is shrouded in mystery and the police did not do enough to get to the bottom of the case in my opinion love had something to do with his death someone needs to prompt the police to reopen this case so coabin can recieve justice courtney s own father even believes she killed cobain

the reason that parents don t let their kids have licenses in general is that they don t want their kids to get hurt kids get hurt again in general because they are immature and don t know how to stay out of trouble parents don t want kids to make potentially lethal mistakes the way to change parents minds then is by proving to them just how responsible mature and non reckless you really are this takes time but i m sure you know what to do
for years my brother wouldn t even talk to me in fact when i would talk to me he would often punch me or berate me for being fat or ugly how did i fix it we both grew up he s and i m now and we could not be better friends you really just have to give it time when siblings are younger they will be horrible to each other but when they grow up they realize that the relationships you have together are so very valuable i m sorry that he s mean to you now though i m sure it will change
depending on our situation meeting people to become friends with can be very easy or extremely difficult clubs local organizations activities schools church libraries book stores gyms jogging parks beach lakes malls etc can all be places to meet new people once you ve met them talking and keeping the person interested is probably the most important thing to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask simple friendly questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc become genuinely interested in the other person there are lots of ways to start a conversation keeping yourself informed on current events staying involved in activities and keeping a mental list of good topics of discussion are excellent ways to break the ice for other topics to talk about you can search the internet about things that you or the people you will be talking with are interested in if you like games perhaps search for the latest information about the x box games pc games ps revolution etc if you like tv shows movies books pets etc a few jokes from time to time can also be a great ice breaker also remember that body language is very important most people don t even realize it but most times you ll already have made a lot of decisions about the person by their body language and tone before you re more than a minute into a conversation you want to be cool calm and collected act like the person is an old friend even if you ve never talked to them before and make sure to look them in the eye instead of focusing on how uncomfortable you feel prepare yourself by thinking of the issues that interest you most and what you would like to discuss about a particular subject a little preparation can go a long way pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written

wow you don t have to be a genius to realise what a bummer of a situation you are in i had a friend in this situation except your mom seems to be sticking in the middle of the u s and that is curious to me usually if people are on the move it is toward bigger and better and i have actually been to every single town you have lived in just visiting i have always lived in tx and they aren t so great have you tried sitting down with her and describing the need that you have or asking her what compels her so much to keep on the move what is she running from or what does she gain in being a rolling stone try to convey to her what a turmoil it is putting you in to not have a stable environment to become a well adjusted normal person try to understand what her logic is to moving all the time and at the same time convey to her that you need more stability let it sink in and then let her know how you feel about durant ok good luck

state what you are going to prove list ideas that prove your statement conclude by saying what you just proved e g beginning it s not good for kids under the age of to walk to and home from school alone five supporting points it subjects children to victimization by criminals it subjects kids to physical injury while crossing the street kids who are victims of crime are subject to grow up with deep traumas and sometimes have lasting phobias parents whose children are kidnapped murdered molested etc are sometimes more likely to be less productive members of society due to life long grief and related emotional problems a parents who fail to adequately provide for the safety of their children increase the burden on law enforcement agencies who have to incur time and resources in locating children or b all society is hurt when children are hurt because everyone loves children conclusion therefore due to the fact that and parents should not allow children under the age of to walk to and from school unchaparoned by an adult or responsible older child that s just an example your essay is something you want to prove it has a beginning a middle and an end it can be anything from why it s tough to make it in the world today to why i ve chosen to be a when i graduate have fun with it and goodluck be sure to choose a narrow topic it gets crazy when you choose a broad topic then brainstorm only stopping to make rough notes of what comes out of your mind just let all your thoughts about the subject flow out uninhibited don t interrupt the flow then look closely at all the rough ideas and select the best ones hopefully you ll have or more next pick the top five your very best points now you have your topic and excellent points to support your topic p s it s a good idea to deal with ideas that are the extreme position of yours but discuss them in your essay to dispel them or break them down whenever you write anything assume that the reader already knows the other side so deal with it acknowledging it but topple it with your points for example for point above which reads subjects children to victimization by criminals some parents will say we live in a safe neighborhood and no children have ever been harmed in our neighborhood you might want to write some parents believe their neighborhoods are safe and permit their children to walk to and from school other parents allow their children to walk to and from school because the school is onely a couple of blocks down the street the reason neither of these ideas are good ones is because statistics have shown that child molesters are subject to pick up kids from affluent neighborhoods as they are from other ones sometime like that gotta run hope it helps

i was just asked to write something for my deceased uncle and aunt and so this question naturally caught my attention for a memorial service i have found that words which are typically dignified yet interspersed with a couple no more than that i don t think personal memories are so needed and appreciated by grieving friends and family i m not an expert or anything but i will never forget one service where the person speaking said something to this effect i will never forget the way chuck laughed i can still see him laughing silently his shoulders a bit hunched up tears coming to his eyes when something was so funny he couldn t stand it that was such a simple memory yet one that every person there could relate to with all that was said and done at that memorial service i bet it was that one sentence that people remembered more than anything another similar memory was a funeral for a woman who had died an alcoholic there were many difficult memories for people but again that one personal memory stood out someone mentioned that when she laughed she threw her head back and had an infectious contagious laughter that was not self concious it made many grieving people happier to remember some of this woman s better qualities i guess in conclusion i d try to keep things short and simple put in all the basic facts but leave at least one memory that reminds people of the lighter side of things life isn t all serious a memorial service is a chance to celebrate life as a whole you ve been given a great honor to say a few words on behalf of your friend maybe there s something about sports you could write one very funny and precious memory you will always carry

eagles eye gave the very simplistic answer the bigger answer lies in how wal mart buys they are a hard bargainer when our company wanted to try to offer our products to wal mart we found out just how hard wal mart wanted discount off retail day terms full return availability at days and us to pay the freight both ways if the item goes over real well then they want about times as much product right away and even longer terms what this does is hang the manufacturers out for months waiting for payments that is the toughest part of what wal mart does to make money nothing wrong with that either almost every large corporation has a permanent field office in bensonville just to handle the wal mart account and they are there because of the volume that wal mart generates retail businesses rely on volume to make money they run on a very small net profit margin compared to other forms of businesses most grocers for instance run on about net profit so if a store does m a year in sales they make about profit that is not a great return on investment unless you have a lot of stores wal mart just pushes the envelope on the purchasing end so that they can give us lower prices yet still make the big money

there are several ways to make money by buying shares any shares bought are obviously owned by you you can keep the shares if they are good and profitable company and wait for dividents usually paid quarterly half yearly or sometimes annually meaning once a year but usually if you want to make better money buy the shares at a lower price during a poor market wait for the price of that share to go up draw a margin how much you want to make and sell at that price when it reaches that amount of your choice sometimes your broker may advise you to hold on because he may know the price is going up further and you may be able to make more when market is good it is more advisable to sell on profit rather than wait for the dividends which are usually very much lower than the market gains having advised all that please do not be too greddy or obssessed by the share market otherwise you may burn your fingers and lose all that you have earned or more

i like the ones with the yellow plastic trip pads the best and they can be set easily they work much better than the all metal ones with copper metal looking trip pads one trick to make setting them easier is to glue or otherwise attach two of them about inches apart on a x inch piece of pine wood or similar you get a scrap piece of wood about inches long and after attaching the mousetraps use peanut butter dabs on the trip pads then set the trap farthest from you on the board just be ready to pull your hand away quickly after lodging the wire under the pad notch then carefully set the trap that s closer to you on the board of course you can just put one trap per board if you wish but the main advantage is that you can easily hold the board to place the traps carefully without tripping them

find a lawyer i do believe you first have to offer some sort of repayment plan options if you fail to come to agreement then you have to send a letter of demand in full send it certified so that they have to sign for it when it is delivered do not wave the signature if they refuse delivery or do not comply with the letter then you have to turn it over to an attorney to start foreclosure proceedings it can take up to months for a foreclosure to complete and during that time the people can stay living in the house if the people do seek debt relief through bankruptcy then they will only be obligated to pay what the courts tell them and you will have to accept what ever paymeant terms ordered by the courts or they may be entitled to remove all debt and owe you nothing if that is the case then they will lose the house and ownership of it will be transferred to you it is usually in the lenaders best interest to try to work out payment options as foreclosure is an expensive process and you usually end up taking a loss offer a short sale in which you agree to accept less than owed on the house if they sold the house a repayment plan or financial hardship assistance deed in leau of foreclosure where they would agree to sign the house over to you and protect their credit rating you really should seek an attorney to find out what the best option for you is keep in mind that the borrowers can always file bankruptcy after the foreclosure process as well you could end up with nothing good luck

pay more than your minimum balance as much as you possibly can if you have any or transfer deals that last for the life of the transfer go for it this is the best way to deal with large debt one thing i can say from experience don t go crazy on spending to try to create a credit history for yourself small purchases and paying them off is all it takes if you are already in big debt stop using your card and just use cash if you can t afford what you want then wait until you can afford it but try to hold off and use that money towards paying the cc debt i opened up my first cards like years ago and didn t know what i was doing i used to buy all kinds of stuff on them just because i was trying to help myself to grow my credit well i found out the long and tedious way that this is not a good idea after long years of buckling down and being on a strict budget we are finally out of debt i never missed payments and always remained in good standing with my creditors after paying off the we are now debt free now i use the credit card the way it was really designed for to not have to have cash on me at the time but to know that i can pay it off in full when that bill comes credit is not ment for living beyond your means it is a tool to be used wisely so many people out there now a days live way beyond their means in that they put everything on credit and then pay the minimums if you can t afford to buy it today with the cash in your account then you just can t afford it if you adopt this attitude you will keep yourself from alot of heartache and mountains of cc debt good luck be smart about using your cc

yes you can humans are creatures of habit you can completely change yourself but if what you want to change into something contrary to your values you will probably not succeed you may want to start by looking at things from different perspectives try understanding why before you judge something once upon a time there was a man who lived in a cannibal tribe this man refused to eat humans throughout this mans life the man refused to give into eating people this man was also not accepted by his tribe many years later the man come to believe that being like everybody else was ok eventually the man became a cannibal and was accepted by his tribe this is a story do not take this seriously the moral of the story has meaning though society sets the norms we live by we all have different belief and values but really take a good look at yourself and the people you share your life with you will find that you all share many common beliefs you may try asking yourself why you want to change in the first place if your problem is anger or compulsion talk to a psychiatrist do not be ashamed of this if you need help get help and fix the problem then enjoy your life if you spend more time looking within yourself you will find more and more problems this is usually why many people become depressed your problems can start to disappear when you help others and just participate in life you analise yourself too much

a simple sluice is a piece of pvc split lengthways with ribbed mat glued inside this would be for recovery of very fine gold using a pond pump for water flow it depends on the type of material you want to process what type of sluice box you need beach boxes have no riffles and long tom sluices use their extreme length to be efficient gold catchers no offense to dpacman but the sluice shown in the link is not for a very good sluice box it will probably catch some gold but it will miss much of the fine stuff especially when those riffles become clogged with tailings it would take a large volume of water to make this box work due to it s design it is short and the riffles don t look very efficient nor did i see mention of any kind of matting i would also add a wider water entry adding length and wider entry to force more water through would make it quite heavy it may catch larger pieces of gold but you would lose much of the fines which are more prevalent the keys to using a sluice box is classifying your material with screen usually for stream use and having proper fall and water flow i would suggest rather than trying to build one unless you have sheetmetal skills that you purchase a used one from e bay or from a prospecting site like http www goldprospectors org this is the gpaa website and members are usually selling their surplus equipment a long sluice is a good size for a beginner and you can probably get one for under a hundred bucks i ve seen those plastic ones advertised new for besides all the pans shovels buckets and other gear needed to sluice you really don t want to carry a heavy sluice around that doesn t work very well check out that site follow the links and sign up to join the forum there are lots of good people who will be happy to answer any questions you have about prospecting mucho au u

there are a few answers to this question the differences revolve around what your idea of guaranteed is truly guaranteed monthly income in exchange for a lump sum of money is best achieved by purchasing an annuity either an immediate annuity if you need the stream of income to start now or a deferred annuity if you can wait for the income to start based on several factors including your age sex health expected mortality amount of initial investment crediting interest rate and payment option choice the insurance company will pay you a guaranteed monthly income either for a set period of time or the rest of your life your payment options could also be structured to continue some level of payment to a spouse after your passing it is important to remember that the guarantee is only as good as the insurance company issuing the annuity in other words don t buy an annuity from a poorly rated insurance company no matter how good it looks on paper another alternative for producing monthly income from a lump sum is to ladder a bond portfolio or even include some dividend paying stocks while there is no guarantees this way an experienced financial planner can give you a reasonable chance of producing a steady income monthly also this option allows you to retain control of your principal unlike the annuity

you can just try to get through the class the best you can or you can transfer or you can drop it and take it again with a different professor there is something else you could look into if there are other students who view this class as you do then you could find some other students taking pre law and approach it as a breaking of a contract that is you have a form of a contract with the school to receive specific instruction it was defined when you paid the money for the course the professor and the school have broke the contract by teaching something else and you can sue them for your financial damage the cost of the course and the waste of time of course this is a difficult road to travel and there is no guarantee of succeeding i believe it was tried successfully once at a university in missouri where the professor was senile many years ago i was in econ and the instructor someone from a mid east country was teaching it from a socialistic perspective that is a false foundation for the class at that point i had served a hitch in the army was married with two children and had been working i would ask questions in class that he couldn t answer and he eventually told me to not ask anymore so after class i went to his office and we had a very frank discussion i ended up telling him he had two options the first was that he would let me out of the class with no problems and all of my money returned the second is that we would go to the dean s office and have a frank discussion concerning his teaching methods with the dean and i would be accompanied by the state legislator a friend of the family who then headed the education committee he decided to let me out of the class it all comes down to what you are after

in the us you are an utter fool if you do not consult a patent attorney the process is so overwhelmingly complicated that only a specialist will even consider taking it and you will get nowhere trying to do it yourself it involves a search of existing patents to see if yours is too close to something else and how to define too close is a matter of much case law this is a sorting mechanism in another way if you can t find a patent attorney who will take you seriously and if you are not willing to pay this initial expense to do the search then it is probably not worth your while at all there are also speculators who will buy up your design and undergo this expense themselves if they thing an invention is worth it again the sorting if these high risk speculators are not interested the thing is not commercially viable back to the drawing board

the whole chapter bankruptcy process takes about four to six months costs in filing and administrative fees without an attorney and commonly requires only one trip to the courthouse to file for bankruptcy you fill out a two page petition and several other forms then you file the petition and forms with the bankruptcy court in your area basically the forms ask you to describe your property your current income and its sources your current monthly living expenses your debts property you claim the law allows you to keep through the bankruptcy process for example most states let you keep clothing household furnishings social security payments you haven t spent and other basic items property you owned and money you spent during the previous two years and property you sold or gave away during the previous two years filing for bankruptcy puts into effect something called the automatic stay the automatic stay immediately stops your creditors from trying to collect what you owe them so at least temporarily creditors cannot legally grab garnish your wages empty your bank account go after your car house or other property or cut off your utility service or welfare benefits until your bankruptcy case ends your financial problems are in the hands of the bankruptcy court it assumes legal control of the property you own except your exempt property which is yours to keep and the debts you owe as of the date you file nothing can be sold or paid without the court s consent you have control however with a few exceptions of property and income you acquire after you file for bankruptcy the court exercises its control through a court appointed person called a bankruptcy trustee the trustee is mostly interested in what you own and what property you claim as exempt this is because the trustee s primary duty is to see that your creditors are paid as much as possible on what you owe them and the more assets the trustee recovers for creditors the more the trustee is paid the trustee goes through the papers you file and asks you questions at a short hearing called the creditors meeting which you must attend this meeting is not likely to last more than five minutes creditors may attend too but rarely do after this meeting the trustee collects the property that can be taken from you your nonexempt property to be sold to pay your creditors you can surrender the property to the trustee pay the trustee its fair market value or if the trustee agrees swap some exempt property of equal value for the nonexempt property if the property isn t worth very much or would be cumbersome for the trustee to sell the trustee can abandon the property which means that you get to keep it very few people actually lose property in bankruptcy if you ve pledged property as collateral for a loan the loan is called a secured debt the most common examples of collateral are houses and motor vehicles in most cases you ll either have to surrender the collateral to the creditor or make arrangements to pay for it during or after bankruptcy if a creditor has recorded a lien against your property that debt is also secured you may be able to wipe out the lien in bankruptcy if after you file for bankruptcy you change your mind you can ask the court to dismiss your case as a general rule a court will dismiss a chapter bankruptcy case as long as the dismissal won t harm the creditors usually you can file again if you want to although you may have to wait days at the end of the bankruptcy process most of your debts are wiped out discharged by the court you no longer legally owe your creditors you can t file for chapter bankruptcy again for another six years from the date of your filing

here is what i would sugest for you to do gather up your last months bank statements for all accounts your last pay stubs last years w s or tax returns then go to a mortgage company and tell them you want to prequal they will pull your credit and then use the documents you brought in to figure out how much house you can afford at what interst rate and how they will need to structure the loan once you have this information i would sugest obtaining a real estate agent the reason is this the buyer pays nothing for having an agent the agent gets paid by the seller once the house is sold so it is in your best interest to have one tell the agent what you qualify for and what you are looking for they will pull up properties in mls and then you can choose the ones you want to see the other benifit of having a real estate agent is that they will look out for your best interest in regards to the repc and typically will not let you get hosed by the lender either this is important if you are new to all of this if you have a good lender and a good agent then you should not have anything to worry about ask lots of questions to the lender you can learn alot about the process

photograph copyright advice and tips few photographers have a complete understanding of copyright legislation and its implications but once you start operating as a freelance it becomes vitally important otherwise you could find yourself financially out of pocket or at the wrong end of a legal battle words pictures lee frost copyright legislation exists so that work generated by photographers writers and artists is protected by law thus preventing unauthorised reproduction of that work without the prior permission of the author and ensuring some kind of economic deal is struck which pleases all parties involved it also states that you have the right to be identified as the author of that work and that it cannot be subjected to derogatory treatment in other words if you take a photograph that s published you have a right to be paid by the publisher a suitable fee for its reproduction and the right to be identified as the creator of that picture in the form of a credit or byline similarly it also protects the client in so far as if you assign copyright for a particular image to them then you are in breach of copyright and liable to a penalty if copyright for the same image is assigned or licensed to another client especially in a competing market traditionally photographers have been seen as inferior to artists and writers in terms of copyright fortunately due to changes in copyright legislation if you take a photograph you are now considered the author of it whether it was commissioned or not no matter who supplied the film and therefore have first ownership on that copyright the only exception to this is if you are an employed photographer in which case the photographs you take as part of your regular job are the property of your employer as freelance photographers by nature don t fall into this category you needn t worry about it assignment of copyright at some point in your career you may complete a commissioned job for a client and be asked to assign copyright to them by signing a contract unless you have a good reason for doing so such as being offered what you feel is a fair financial settlement avoid this as you could lose out in the future the size of this settlement will depend on the client s reason for requesting that copyright be assigned to them if they intend using the picture repeatedly in future brochures say then you should agree a fee for each repeat use the same applies if they intend syndicating them to other companies or using the pictures for publicity purposes if future use can t be specified then insist on retaining copyright and negotiating fresh deals for every subsequent use of the pictures and get everything in writing so there can be no confusion about what has been agreed if you do decide to re assign copyright to another party remember they become the owner of those images in their entirety for all time so you no longer have any claim on revenue generated from further sales however by retaining copyright simply by refusing to sign it away even if the client holds those images on their own property they must still seek your permission to sell them and agree a financial payment to you from any sales revenue legally they must also provide you with access to those pictures so you can offer them for sale yourself although maintaining this can be difficult so whenever possible insists on holding the pictures on your own files as an example of how this can work it is not uncommon for magazines to run their picture files like a stock agency and generate extra profit by selling images to advertisers book publishers and so on if some of those pictures were taken by you during commissioned jobs for that magazine then by law you are entitled to a share in the profits however if you assign copyright for those pictures to the magazine s publisher you are not entitled

your question is difficult as there are so many factors involved with depression i am no doctor but have had many relationships with people who suffer from depression and will share what little i know first i would make sure that you are doing some basic healthy behaviors like eating a well balanced meal exercising regularly avoid acohol tabacco and such and get outdoors into the sun your personal health has a direct impact on your emotional health second find someone with whom you can speak a professional or a very good friend having an outlet will allow you to release some of the tension you have built up holding it all in is not healthy and will lead to irrational thoughts go out and be with others if you can and avoid locking yourself in your room next honestly think about what the underlying issues are that are causing you feelings of depression once you figure out what the issues truly are think about what you can change about yourself and your behavior that may improve the situation we can only control our own behavior so it is best to start with ourselves since whatever you have been doing is not working make sure not to continue behaviors that contribute to or agitate the situation after you have started working on yourself you really need to open the lines of peaceful rational communications with the others involved it is very possible that they may have no idea that they are causing you pain or even understand believe you once you tell them what you feel be patient i have never seen anyone instantly cured of depression like most things that are worthwhile in life this is going to take some effort if you really start to feel out of control please seek professional help finally god has a greater understanding of things than we do if you believe in god let him help you out james if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him let me know if there is anything that i can do to help

dear wolverine there is nothing more attractive then someone who likes themselves who appreciates and respects who they are and how they are and intend to evolve your best chance at getting someone to like you is to be yourself no pretense if this girl can t like you for who you are she is the wrong girl for you pretending to be anyone other than yourself for example pretending to like something you really don t because you heard this girl likes it or pretending to act think of feel a certain way to align with how this particular girl thinks or feels may gain you a temporary connection but it won t gain you a good or lasting friendship bottom line be who you are no one in all the world can be you like you can someone once said that there are people in the world who are perfect for us the key to happiness is to find them and not waste precious time trying to please others by being someone were not just to be liked by them so go for it just be yourself with this girl and see if she turns out to be one of your priceless people if she doesn t don t let it get you down just keep being yourself and eventually you ll run into one of your perfect matches i ve included a great source that supports this line of thinking as well as one that challenges the just be yourself point of view so you can read and then decide for yourself i ve also included a link to some pointers for telling someone that you like them for all you know she may already like you just as you are but one of you has to approach the subject and let the other know the big question to ask yourself is if you are pretending to be something you re not how long will you enjoy doing that how long before she sees right through the pretense is pretending worth a short journey with someone who will eventually find out if you re faking it wishing you the joy of discovering a genuine match for yourself kaocc
okay i m a retired cop here s what you need to do first answer these questions as the reporting officer who what where when and how who complainant address phone number for home and work and of course the name what burglary of a habitation or business or motor vehichle specify where not only the address but you need to describe the building in detail i e residence when the time of the incident narrow it down as much as you can betweent the hours of such and such or if you have a witness the time the witness specifies but keep it kind of open because witnesses are not always correct on their time but it does need to be noted when time of the offense or estimated time how where and how the entry was gained possible path that the suspect took through the house and the description of the actual damage where entry was gained or if it was through an open window or unlocked door etc in the body of the report you want to write down what you were told by the complainant ex complainant states that he left for work on at approx am and had made sure that the doors and windows were secured when the complainant arrived home at approximately pm he found that the front door of the residence had been forcefully opened and was ajar the complainant then immediately called the police upon his discovery that his residence had been burglarized keep it short and sweet but detailed then you want to list what is missing from the from the residence in this manner stolen property pair of k gold earrings single diamond in gold setting value estimatied and so on try to list make model serial numbers and if they have photos of the property include them especially for weapons get as much information on those as you can as they will probably be used in other crimes you want a paragraph with suspect information if you have any race height clothing weight vehichles or on foot where the suspect was seen and what he was doing possible names if you have one be detailed on physical description especially hair color length facial hair etc then you want to make sure and put in a paragraph of any witnesses names address phone number what they saw if they can possibly identify the suspect and if they are willing to look at a line up if the suspect is caught or if they would make a statement for detectives and would look at mug shots you want a summary at the end to briefly state what your actions were whether you took photos fingerprints and if you ve entered anything into evidence you need to be specific and write down all numbers and chain of custody of the said evidence you also need to include in the report the disposition ex forward to investigations i hope this helps you it s not as easy as it looks to actually do it if you want to do it right it s important to remember that the person calling the police has been victimized and you should be as thorough as possible in order to do the job you are sworn to do the right way do not do it half way do the best you can with the information that you receive even it seems unimportant put it in the report good luck phew

scouting is about learning lifelong skills while each scout troop has to follow the same bsa program it is the variations of the unit leaders and committee that create the flavor of the unit the best way is to visit each troop in the area and ask questions explain to the leaders that you are trying to find troop that best fits your expectations they will by human nature only tell you the positives i was a scoutmaster for years i was also a unit commossioner so i was able to see the intricate ways in which the personality of each troop had it s own strengths and weaknesses some troops are eagle factories they pump out a higher than average amount of eagle scouts the national average is that join eventually make eagle scout if it is a small troop of boys be cautious if each year they have eagle scouts i say cautious because their program may be such that it is geared to create eagles but not geared to the overall national well rounded program but most likely is a good indication of a troop that teaches leadership and values may be just the fact that the troop leadership still retains former scouts as new young leaders after they turn and are out of the youth portion of the program a unit with only middle aged dads moms may indicate that once a kid outgrows the troop then so will the family plus young leaders are an energetic asset to a unit no sore backs another key thing to see is if the age of the scouts seems to spread evenly for all ages nothing is more diheartening than a troop with all year olds with a new scout not relating to anyone and the fact that within a year all the senior scouts will be gone off to college and leave a huge void in the troop partols beciuse there are no year olds fill the void of youth leadership remember that parental involvement in boy scouts is supposed to be more hands off than in cubscouts if the adults seem to be doing all the work in a troop the scouts may be missing their opportunity to learn leadership watch for this in an eagle factory troop the joke is that dad earned his rd eagle scout badge with this son

dear sir i am very sorry to hear of your situation but the truth is you couldnt stop her if she does not love you enough to stay faithful to you then it was only a matter of time before she left you sound like a very nice and caring man but sometimes that isnt enough there are too many factors to weigh to fully understand your situation but i suggest you speak with a counselor to help you cope with this painful situation sometimes there is nothing we can do and we need to just let go i personally would not have any desire to be with someone that longs for someone else i would probably not have even given her another chance after the first time but if i was able to get past that if it were just a mistake and she would not do it again i would definitely not give her a second chance i never would let my wife go spend time with another man overnight unless the circumstances were clearly reasonable i cant think off the top of my head of any reason a spouse man or woman ever would need to spend the night with anyone of the opposite sex i am sure there may be a situation where its reasonable but typically married couples should be at home with each other if you would like to talk about it further feel free to join the support forum below and there will be othersthere that can relate or have good advice

i went through intense persection when i was working for a female supervisor she really was a witch and i used to say tht her other car was a broom stick you said how do you deal with this person not how can this person change i am proud of you because you fully realize she wont change unless she wants to also what comes out of the mouth reflects the heart i prayed constantly it was hard dealing with a person that i could not please someone who was backbiting twofaced and well as overly demanding sometimes the best workers get the worst treatment the best thing you can do is do your job and go home and not be friends with her but work with her there is a difference god gets the last word and god gets the last say this person hurt a lot of people and was reported to human resource this was one of the reasons she was demoted from a supervisor to a clerical assistant like my self she was hurt and felt that she was treated unfarily yet this was the way she treated everyone else getting a taste of your own medicine does not taste good another way to put it what goes around comes around and you get what you give life is full of people who re difficult and not easy to get a long with you dont learn patience and maturity when everyone is nice to you you learn and develop charcter adn integity when people are mean this is the real world the scrpiture that got me though those horrid years with bad unqulified supervisors was no weapon formed against you shall propser and every tongue that rises up against you will be proven in the wrong isaiah never take peoples rotten personalities personally and don t personalize rejection because how a person treats you is more has to do with the way the they feel about themselves a good gauge or measure to see if a person truly loves others is if they first love themselves be encouraged

the general rule of thumb is that it takes money to make money but i did happen to find an exception to the rule so to speak i started selling a few things on ebay it is very easy i had to quit work due to a bladder disease and i too needed to come up with some money you would not believe what sells on ebay go on there look around and see what is selling i know a good one for me was to go to local thrift stores and buy medical scrubs that were in good shape i would then wash them and list them on ebay and would usually make per item after a bit it adds up look around your house i guarantee you have some things that would make a profit remember one persons trash is another persons treasure

you cannot start any business without money you may need supplies tools materials staffing etc in order to get a business going and in order to get a business going you need to have money upfront in order to get the things you need to get it started so how about some ways you can try to get some money whether its a gift or a loan to start a business ask relatives and friends for their help ask the bank be prepared to have a very well written business plan so that the bank sees that they can profit off of you in the case that they do give you a loan to start your own business remember that a high percentage of first businesses fail because their business was poorly planned start saving up some money now if you have a job then put aside a large amount of your paycheque each week bi weekly monthly to save up for starting your own business sell some of your collectibles or expensive items art artifacts etc on ebay and try to make some profit on the side do it illegally rob a bank steal from others deal drugs etc if you don t care about getting caught and going to prison that s all i can think of for right now but if you truly have a good business plan don t let money stop you from opening up your own business if you can convince the bank to give you a loan i think that is the best way to go plenty of people who had little money or no money but who had a great business plan and idea made millions from opening their own businesses and following their dreams good luck

well if i understand the difference between precognition and prophecy correctly it would need to be with your beliefs first of all let s pray that it s neither i would hate to see your friend harmed and his family traumatized so perhaps at least share this dream with him just to help him stay on his toes during travel but as to your question if the dream was prophetic it would be as though a divine inspiration had taken place you would have been sent a sign from a higher power warning you of the upcoming event do you believe in this this is a whole other issue and i soooooo won t go into asking you maybe i ll post it as a question but many do believe that angels are sent to warn us and prepare us for what lies ahead if it were a precognition you would have extra sensory perception if you have ever experienced a certain clairvoyance this could be what you have experienced here scientists have decided that the brain can have abilities to see beyond rare as it may be it could exist again something we have to think about and find belief in again i would share this dream with your friend no matter what the concern for his safety is there who knows if you tell him the dream he might take the train instead

whenever i need to learn how to do something and don t want to pay exhorbitant lawyer fees i look for a book or books that explain how to do what i want to do i would check amazon com for books on the subject i checked and found one on collecting judgements in california that may not be perfect for you but i ll bet there are many similarities between california and your state once you learn the basics learning the differences between california and your state will be easier from the courthouse clerk or from the librarian of a local law library many courthouses have one plus once you learn the basics their explanations won t sound so much like they re speaking another language i have a book in my home library called small claims court without a lawyer by w kelsea wilber and chapter includes info on garnishments attachments levies liens etc this book is copyright so i wouldn t necessarily recommend it to you but it s just an illustration of what s possible also every state is different if there s a law school near you they ll have a great law library and usually very helpful librarians the clerk at the courthouse where you got your judgement would be able to help you if he she has the right attitude that person would probably be good to talk to after you learn all the basics so your conversation is more aimed at the differences between the basics and what your local system requires if you start trying to get them to teach you the basics they re probably not going to want to be bothered since that would generally take a lot of teaching and of course the clerk is not a lawyer about years ago i wanted to change my name so i went to a law library downtown and found the law that explained how to do it i copied the form out of the law book copied it into my computer at home so it was nice and neat filled it out on the computer and took it down to the courthouse at the courthouse i d tell a clerk what i wanted to do and they d help or direct me i went before the judge on my own he asked me a question as to why i was changing my name you re not allowed to change your name for deceptive purposes and he signed my form even adding the specific court designation himself to the top of the form that i d left off that i should have included i walked out went to the office where they process the completed form paid the fee they gave me a certified copy of the name change and i was done cool and i didn t have to spend a penny in lawyer fees good luck
you have to start with a resume that says what you really want to do not something vague example to find a job as a sales trainee where i can use my strong interpersonal skills lots of people put down something like i want a position that will afford me personal growth that goes into the wastebasket another mistake people make is to just look at help wanted ads only of all jobs are filled through ads get out the yellow pages and look up companies that have the job you want call up and ask if you can fax over the resume and to who s attention follow up in a week with a phone call

yesterday i answered a similar question on here and here is what i wrote to summarize basically control your proportions calories of what you eat it may not be as effective as if you were to exercise with it but it should help some i have to disagree with the others who say to avoid the snacking that s not completely true it just depends on what you snack on and the amount you eat also don t be so hard on yourself being too strict can lead to failure you just have to make a committment and visualize yourself meeting your weight loss goal anytime you get a craving for something wait minutes before you try to eat it in minutes your craving should go away just don t leave the food sitting in front of you i ve gone on a safe and healthy diet and lost pounds successfully in just over months i ve spoken to a personal trainer at bally total fitness as well as doctors and they ve told me that my diet combined with exercise is the most effective and safest way to lose weight keep in mind that it is undavised to lose more than pounds it s not really safe also never eat less than calories per day you never want to starve yourself to lose weight because your body will react as if it is a life threatening emergency and so it will slow down your metabolism in order to save calories energy stored up in your body once you stop starving yourself and start eating normally again you will actually gain all your weight back plus extra so as you can see this is a bad way to lose weight here is how i diet and i highly recommend this you want to eat small meals a day rather than normal small sized meals if you eat more often throughout the day it gets your metabolism going and you burn more calories effectively keep a log of everything you consume that way you can actually see and better what you re actually eating and if you need to make any changes to your diet in fact it is best to plan everything you eat ahead of time i usually do this the day before you want to record things such as the food item how many servings you plan on eating see below for serving suggestions and most importantly the calories in each food servings x calories per serving total calories consumed for that food make sure what you are eating is healthy and that your meals are well balanced the average adult ideally should consume about calories everyone s metabolism is different so some people can eat more than others and still lose weight it s hard to say how many calories you should consume but for me i had a test done that concluded i can consume calories without gaining weight knowing that i don t eat more than calories per day to lose weight i have a slow metabolism if you think your metabolism is a little faster you can eat more than what i do to lose weight but whatever amount of calories u consume everyday stick with that servings one serving is what that package of the box says not your judgement of what you think looks satisfying not every type of food will state what one serving is one serving of meat is ounces if you don t have a food scale ounces is about the size of a deck of cards for vegetables cup is a good serving size but you don t have to worry too much about eating too much fruits or veggies many tend to be low in calories and are very healthy for you anyway so eat up actually measuring your servings in a measuring cup is a great way to see how much you really should be eating and compare it to what you used to eat another good tip drink water with everything you eat you will feel more full this way also like i said about eating times a day instead of will also prevent you from feeling hungry and cheating on your diet eat something every hours when you eat at restaurants look for items on the menu that are grilled boiled baked or steamed

if you want to keep the colours vibrant then try silica drying silica gel silica gel can be found in most garden centers nurseries florist or hobby shops it absorbs moisture from flowers rapidly thus preserving flower color better than other drying methods most flowers will dry in to hours use silica gel in an airtight container or it will absorb moisture from the air not from the flower tissues you can redry the silica gel in a warm oven not in a microwave and reuse it for other flowers later winifrede morrison s book drying preserving flowers gives details on the use of silica gel flowers that dry well in either borax or silica gel include rose aster carnation marigold dahlia larkspur geranium zinnia chrysanthemum and delphinium one word of caution when using the homemade agents or silica gel the flowers will sometimes reabsorb moisture and wilt for best success with flowers dried in an agent display your flowers in a closed container to keep out dust and high humidity
although we all need different amounts of sleep i would generally agree with talk doms you may actually be starting a second sleep cyle and so are awaking from a deep sleep which isn t too good i would recommend a medical check up first and then make sure you have a standard sleep routine which includes a short time for reflection and relaxation the routine helps your brain follow a set pattern allowing it to shut down your life sounds stressed is there anybody who can share the load are all the things that need to be done essential do you need to answer your emails straight away are you getting enough exercise are you getting into a rut and ignoring your social and sexual needs when was the last time you had a real holiday might also be a time to reasses your life and work good luck

you re having trouble it s a good thing that you recognize it in another post you blamed a friend that is bugging you while that may be part of it it s really important that you take a good hard look in the mirror and realize that you re responsible for yourself have you been doing other things instead of finishing your homework are you getting enough sleep at night and eating right take good care of yourself and try not to stress out th grade may seem tough but you ve got lots of years ahead of you seek out the help of your teacher your parent or guardian and your good friends sometimes you just need a math concept or other assignment explained to you in a different way you can do it dig in and work hard nothing in this life comes without dedication and commitment even in th grade good luck

the cathode ray tube almost all tvs in use today rely on a device known as the cathode ray tube or crt to display their images lcds and plasma displays are sometimes seen but they are still rare when compared to crts it is even possible to make a television screen out of thousands of ordinary watt light bulbs you may have seen something like this at an outdoor event like a football game let s start with the crt however because crts are the most common way of displaying images today inside a crt as you can see in the below drawing there s not a whole lot to a basic cathode ray tube to see the rest of this go to www howstuffworks com there is a cathode and a pair or more of anodes there is the phosphor coated screen there is a conductive coating inside the tube to soak up the electrons that pile up at the screen end of the tube however in this diagram you can see no way to steer the beam the beam will always land in a tiny dot right in the center of the screen that s why if you look inside any tv set you will find that the tube is wrapped in coils of wires on the next page you ll get a good view of steering coils the terms anode and cathode are used in electronics as synonyms for positive and negative terminals for example you could refer to the positive terminal of a battery as the anode and the negative terminal as the cathode in a cathode ray tube the cathode is a heated filament not unlike the filament in a normal light bulb the heated filament is in a vacuum created inside a glass tube the ray is a stream of electrons that naturally pour off a heated cathode into the vacuum electrons are negative the anode is positive so it attracts the electrons pouring off the cathode in a tv s cathode ray tube the stream of electrons is focused by a focusing anode into a tight beam and then accelerated by an accelerating anode this tight high speed beam of electrons flies through the vacuum in the tube and hits the flat screen at the other end of the tube this screen is coated with phosphor which glows when struck by the beam

like the scouts say be prepared know exactly what you want to ask write each question down on a x card or do the electronic equivalent you st century foxes and sort them until they are in the most logical order if you get an evasive or incomplete answer to any question put it aside and ask it again later or politely ask for clarification never forget your manners except for strategic reasons if for example someone is interviewing a politician and they seem to be slinging a lot of what politician usually sling the stuff the bull left behind you can name that tune but do it in a very polite tone of voice like i find that hard to believe sir of course who you are interviewing and for what purpose makes all the difference if you are interviewing job applicants you know they are nervous they feel you hold all the cards and you do and it is worthwhile to be very gracious and try to put them at their ease if on the other hand you are a reporter for the school paper and you are interviewing a school board member who is blocking a proposal that is very important to the students you can say that pretty directly like i understand you are opposed to proposal x which is very important to the students what would you like to tell the students to justify your position again probe for clarification if you are given a vague answer good luck good interviewing is an art not a science if you have the talent you will go far

i would suggest you get yourself one or two good books on the subject making money in options can be done but it has a different set of risks associated with it than the underlying securities probably the easiest and safest way is to write covered calls as an example lets say you have shares of ibm trading at each you could right a covered call which gives the buyer the right not the obligation to buy the underlying security from you so say you think ibm is going to stay at or maybe even decline during the next months you could write a covered call for shares of ibm with a strike price of this gives the buyer the right to buy the stock from you for you could sell this option for per share times for the shares which puts in your pocket now during the months if the stock falls or stays below the buyer will let the option expire without exercising it you get to keep your if however the stock rises to the buyer will exercise their right to buy the stock from you for you are obligated to sell your ibm stock to them for they would have to pay you times share in this case you wouldn t lose any out of pocket but obviously you lose the opportunity to sell your stock for times shares this is the simplest example there are many other ways to make money or reduce risk through options really if you want to get involved in this get yourself some good books its really a very exciting subject in finance one worth spending the time to learn

people fear flying for many different reasons some people are afraid because they may have heard of people who have died in plane accidents other people may be afraid because when you look out the windows of the plane when you are up in the air you can t see much except clouds still other people might be afraid because they have no control over the plane they may be afraid of hi jacking or other criminal activity on board that they will not be able to escape one up in the air people may be afraid that since they are not flying the plane and they have to trust the pilot that is scary to them because when they are driving a car at least they have some control others might be afraid because they are up in the air and they might be afraid of the plane crashing into water if the plane runs out of gas or they might be afraid of landing will the plane have a soft landing or will the plane come to a screeching halt on ground when it lands there s also always the fear that the pilot not be rested and will fall asleep while trying to fly the plane the fears when it comes to flying are endless there are a few things to remember about these fears though usually if a pilot had a long night before your flight the pilot will sleep in and relax before he goes and flies another flight your flight may end up delayed because of this but it s worth it so that the pilot doesn t fall asleep while trying to fly the plane there are more car crashes than plane crashes by far one major reason for this is because you are up in the air when you are flying and there is not much if any traffic up there you aren t going to crash into another plane or anything while you are up there there is barely any traffic in the air if you are scared about flying you might want to let a stewardess know they might be able to do something to help your flight more comfortable know that there are many safety options on the flight usually your seat on the plane can be taken out and used as a float if any emergencies were to happen also there is an oxygen mask that falls from the ceiling in case any emergencies occur if you are scared when going up into the air or landing don t look out the window it only makes it worse thankfully there is a little bag in the pocket of reading materials they give you in case you get sick try to fly with someone that you trust and love like your spouse this way you can hold his her hand when you are going up or down while flying and they can have the window seat if you are really scared i highly recommend not looking out the window at least not the first few times fly more frequently sounds like strange advice right well the more you fly and the more you get used to it the more comfortable you ll feel and you will get used to it try to preoccupy yourself when on the plane there is usually food and or drink served on the place and that is usually a good way to preoccupy yourself bring a book or crossword puzzle or listen to music

in my experience companies like this eventually get their s in the long run generally if they lack ethics in their dealings with clients they also lack it internally in their accounting and finance and hr functions too you have seen a lot of companies who acted this way make headlines within the past few years enron worldcom lucent etc so we know that it does eventually does catch up with them however none of that solves your short term dilemma so what i would recommend is a multi part strategy that includes a lot of emphasis on what you do well differentiate your products differentiate your services stand head and shoulders over your competition in providing a great experience sure you could try to compete on margins but in the end that only makes you have to sell harder and faster and could eventually bankrupt the company i believe that just as there is room for cheaper and faster there is also room for creating a great buying purchasing experience why else would companies like mercedes benz audi and bmw be around they don t try to compete with honda hyundai and nissan they cater to a specific clientele and show the value of their products from the sales process to the service cycle i think a similar approach while a lot of work may be the only way to compete effectively if you spend your time fighting competitors like you have described above you waste valuable time that you could be better servicing your existing clients focus on them and they will in turn become your best source of leads and word of mouth advertising

you have fallen into the trap that i have been trying to warn people about never pay off an overdue debt unless the creditor in writing agrees to either remove any negative report from your history or changes to paid in full never late the credit reporting agencies only report information given to it by creditors creditors can put whatever they want on it if it s true and certainly can change remove it why in the world would you pay off a debt and not have your credit history reflect that now you still have bad credit plus you are broke the short set of instructions get your credit reports from www annualcreditreport com it s free do it now evamine the reports and note down any negative or inaccurate information send a letter to each credit reporting agency disputing the charge and request that they verify the information note this is differant then validate i ll explain later the credit reporting agency will contact the creditor to see if the report is correct if they do not get a response the report is removed from your records if the creditor responds back that it s accurate the report stays but will have a notation that you are disputing it send a validation letter to the creditor demand a copy of all contracts bills receipts logs or anything that was used to calculate your debt be sent to you they must respond within days if you do not get a response send a copy of the validation request letter plus a complaint to the credit reporting agency if they do send you this information and it s accurate there is not much you will be able to do to fix your record if you paid off the bill you can request that they modify the statis of the account but it s not likely they will since you have paid off the debt there is no incentive for them to even work with you or do you any favors my battle cry you are about to go to war your only weapon is knowledge of the law don t fight these guys unarmed read the links i ve supplied below they will give you all the information you need to fix your credit there are sample letters you can send from this point on keep a log of who you talk to copies of letters you send receive and any records you have regarding your debts contact me if i can be of any help or encouragement i m not a lawyer or credit counsoler just someone who has been down this road and have helped others

there are many many ways to get a green card specifically you can marry an american citizen or participate in the green card lottery diversity program your chances per year are about or enter the us legally on a work visa such as an h b for that visa you need a bachelor s degree or equivalent working experience many people believe this visa is just for computer specialists it just needs to be a specialty occupation for example you could be the chef in a famous indonesian restaurant then you need to find an employer that will sponsor you and that can prove that no american employee is available to do your job if you have a master s degree and have considerable achievements in your field of work pulications for example you can get a visa or green card there are other ways that likely do not apply i am in the us for years now and i am waiting for my green card it is not easy but on the other hand what would it take for an american to get legal permanent residence in indonesia compared to other countries at least there is a process

talking is probably the largest factor i can think of to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc becoming genuinely interested in the other person a somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn t like generally the other person will complain too and you ll have you re conversation you have to be very careful not to do this often because you don t want the other person to think you re a whiner pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written
study modalism not to be confused with patripassianism the trinity was a product of philosophy and politics theological evolution you can see that early trinitarians rarely agreed with each other and all held the heresy of sub ordination it was not until the council of nicea that the trinity was given a solid form that could be built upon by later councils eusubius from which we know most of what we know about nicea went to the council for the express purpose that modalists would not have a voice in the council and they didn t he origianlly went to help arius but had been misinformed about his beliefs and then supported athanasius since esubius liked origen s teachings when studying modalism remember that trinitarians oversimplify the doctrine and label it as patripassianism this comes soley from claims from thier ancient enemies such as tertullian and hippolytus modalism beleives that jesus was the messiah god manifested in the flesh but that he was not god in three persons but rather god in a person who was the image of the invisible god the logos the plan god had in his mind since the beginning patripassianism is the view that the father died on the cross i am not a modalist god did not die on the cross the human flesh died on the cross not the divine spirit that dwelt fully within him were praxeas and sabellius patripassianists really no one can say yes or no all we have are biased writings from thier enemies historically no one knows there is but one god jesus is the name of the father son and holy spirit

first you need to get the swelling down there are several methods available to do this but putting your ankle foot in ice is the best way to start don t just put ice on your ankle put your foot ankle in a bucket of ice water while you have your foot in the ice water start writing the letters of the alphabet with your big toe this will help you relieve some of the stiffness in your ankle and will assist in moving the blood swelling out so you can start the rehab process then you need an aggressive strengthening program r i c e is slow and really only applies to the initial day s after an injury although the rice protocol does help with the pain somewhat it has nothing to rehab your sprained ankle if you don t properly rehab your ankle you will very likely experience more serious and more frequent sprains don t fall for the quick fix patches because a large part of the rehab process is mental you have to believe and know that your ankle is rehabilitated before you will actually be able to return to your normal activities

m define in detail how you want to perform in the interview describe to yourself in words the way you want to be how would you look and sound to a neutral observer e g i see myself in an interview room sitting by a desk i look relaxed and i am smiling alert and energetic i am paying close attention to the other people in the room my posture is upright and i am making conversation easily and effortlessly i exude confidence mentally rehearse the interview from the perspective of an observer in your imagination visualize yourself at the interview comfortable and at ease meeting people feeling relaxed and confident pretend that you are observing yourself from the other side of the room the trick here is to imagine events unfolding in vivid d with rich colors for many people making the image large and close also helps to make it feel more realistic have fun playing with the image until it seems as real as watching t v or a movie screen take care also to introduce sounds maybe the scratching of a pen on paper the squeak of a moving chair or the sound of your own voice exuding authority and confidence you can make sounds come to life by turning up the volume as you imagine that you are listening to full resonant sounds in the room so that it is as if you are really there introduce feeling as well sense the atmosphere in the room the temperature and mood and soak up the aura of success that you exude in the imagined picture then introduce different scenarios for different types of people you may encounter imagine talking to someone who is putting you under pressure see yourself politely dealing with everything thrown at you what will you do if you are left sitting there facing a wall of silence see yourself acting decisively and without fear to move onto the next opportunity to create rapport picture yourself at ease whoever you talk to it is especially important to consider worst case scenarios and to visualize yourself handling each challenge with unstoppable confidence mentally rehearse the interview from your own perspective when you are pleased with the imagined performance you are producing step inside the image of yourself and run through the scenarios again as if you are now doing it see feel and hear it as if it is really happening this time you are looking out into the world from your own eyes so your arms are directly in front of you with people facing you as you feel your clothes on your body allow it all to unfold in great detail make it as real as possible by letting your imagination free to create a rich and colorful panoramic view of a successful day finally pay special attention again to feelings really spend time imagining yourself feeling exactly the way you want to feel and then crank it up and double the intensity until it could not possibly get any better then imagine it even better again set up a peak performance signal ask yourself what signal will you use as a reminder to use your ability to perform in this way i use the feeling of sitting on my own and getting tense as my mind goes blank the signal can be something you see feel or hear inside or outside yourself and it must happen at or close to the point of wanting to speak to someone other examples include seeing yourself surrounded by a group of strangers hearing someone ask you your opinion or the feeling that you want to be more outgoing even as you feel yourself getting more self conscious right now why not use self consciousness to trigger better communication skills imagine the signal happening and visualize yourself performing at your best in the interview some final points like anything in life it takes time to get really good at mental rehearsal using this visualization technique for twenty minutes a day will train your brain to perform new behaviors the results will astound you judge mental rehearsal by trying it out
you have to do a few things actually the first thing is to get another letter from your doctor have him make a few copies of it give one copy to your employer and you keep the original make sure your employer actually reads it in front of you you want extra copies because whenever they pop up and say that they dont have one on file for you you have extras on hand always keep a copy in your purse as proof you also want to contact your local labor board let them know what is going on and if there is anything else that can be done finally you may have to consult an attorney thats your last resort but it may have to be done if your employer is refusing to honor your doctors notes note though that your employer could be trying to force you out as well if you are strong enough to stand your ground do so make sure you are giving him no reason at all to dismiss you then if you do get fired you have ammunition on your side i went through something similiar and it was found in my favor i wish you all the luck in the world you are in a tough spot

don t consider the following discriminatory and dishonest immigration system immigration to canada is based on a point system obtained with your education qualifications and job experience points are good enough for immigration but in canada they are not good enough to get a job in your field amazing how the credentials that qualify you to come to canada are the same credentials that don t qualify you for your profession in canada the reason is canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs pizza delivery driving taxis factory work etc out of control cost of living from rent to utility bills to shopping to phone internet and cable bills to gas to car insurance to eating out to basically anything you have to pay for or buy the cost of living in canada has become astronomical recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is it is estimated that compared to most countries around the world the cost of living in canada is on average five times greater health care crisis practicing physicians in canada are in a shortage in canadians cannot get a family doctor canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the united states statistics canada and the canadian medical association both have identified that for every american doctor that moves to canada nineteen canadian doctors move to the united states doctors in canada are overworked and underpaid and there is a cap on their salaries very high taxes yes you have the gst the pst totaling on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck you have to pay a whopping amount to the government out of your hard earned salary so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking hockey watching welfare bums fair it does not matter it s canada money hungry government canadian embassies around the world lie to foreigners painting this picture that canada is utopia because they want them to come to canada why because foreigners bring money so after being deceived these foreigners come they must bring with them at least canada has an immigration quota of per year so please do the math multiplied by each equals a whopping billion dollars that canada gains from immigrants every year no culture unlike almost every other country in the world canada has no culture actually american culture is what dominates canada when was the last time you had some canadian food there are no canadian traditions and there is no national identity what does it even mean to call yourself a canadian nothing really people living in canada still identify themselves with the country they originally came from worst weather yes canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world freezing cold temperatures snow ice hail winds storms etc from the prairie provinces to the maritimes from the territories to southern ontario the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many canadians leave canada simply because of this reason alone no jobs yes coast to coast there are no jobs immigrants are highly qualified md s phd s lawyers engineers etc but they are driving taxi cabs delivering pizza s or working in factories even people with bachelors degrees from canadian universities cannot find jobs after graduation this is the tragedy associated with immigration to canada i feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in canada for the rest of their lives it is indeed a very sad and hopeless future written by asad raza m d www notcanada com this list was published in the ottawa citizen click here please do not believe the fancy websites made by the government of canada or by the canadian immigration laywers they are not telling you the truth do your own res

approaches come to mind as several above said you could organize an llc if you want to protect your personal assets to do so find the website for your state s secretary of state a k a secretary of commonwealth department of state look for the business or corporation section and in that section you will generally find a link to forms where in turn you ll find articles of organization by organizing an llc in general you ll protect your personal assets from business liabilities just make sure to sign all your contracts with clients in the name of the llc never individually so if your name is wanda you ll sign as wanda member xyz llc not just as wanda but i digress once you file the articles you ll need an operating agreement i don t think you need anything too fancy so do a yahoo or google search for your state operating agreement the operating agreement will have a section explaining what you and your partner are putting in to the company in exchange for your equity in legalese what your capital contribution will be you have to put something in you can each put in services although if you do so the value of the equity you receive will be taxable as wages or cash each should be enough the operating agreement should also have a section that discusses whether the members you and your partner can have outside activities or not usually the members can but in your case you may want to specify that neither member can compete against the llc this will protect your ideas from the other partner using them for his or her sole benefit but do keep in mind to the extent your ideas are even legally protectible and they may not be they would be property of the llc skip the llc and just have a letter agreement b w you and your partner this would be a letter that you give to your partner and at the bottom of the letter your partner signs an acknowledgment like acknowledged and agreed this day day of month the letter would be from you and you d just explain the business you guys plan to carry out how you will each contribute to cover any expenses and how profits will be split in a consulting arrangement a split of profits isn t always fair you split profits based on how much work each partner does usually this is calculated on either invoices collected or hours billed you should also include a section stating that for the duration of the letter agreement neither of you can render similar services except within the scope of the agreement i e you can t do the same stuff on the side and keep all the profits then you should explain how the letter agreement can be terminated maybe days written notice by either party there s a lot to think about so yeah hiring a lawyer may make sense but either of the above approaches would at least get you a start good luck

cold calling that is what you are talking about many strong sales people have had their careers crushed by it s what seems overshadowing power number one reason most fall is because they focus more on what they want to acheive in the telephone conversation rather on what the customer wants selling is nothing more than understanding what your prospect is doing now and helping them do it better the only way you can do that is having a discussion with them and the best way to do that is by asking questions remember too who ever is asking the question is the person in control of the call whether or not you are imposing which you really are my suggestion to you would be this just as you may have talked to a lawyer to keep your business legal and an accountant to help you keep your records invest in yourself and your business by speaking with a cold calling coach that will work with you one on one it will help you better understand your objectives of the calls establish goals and assist you on reaching them you can have the best product in the world but if you can not market it which cold calling seems to be your marketing tool then you can not profit from it lawyers and accountants will cost you a cold calling coach will pay you back guaranted hope this helps feel free to email me with any more questions

when your mobile phone is switched on your cellular network provider knows exactly where you are in the world to within a hundred metres or so similar technology is used to track down lost aircraft and yachts through their radio beacons it s not identical because most radio beacons use satellites and cell phones use land based aerial arrays but the principle is the same at any one time your phone is usually able to communicate with more than one of the aerial arrays provided by your phone network they re ten or twenty kilometers apart less in cities and it s usually within range of at least three of them so by comparing the signal strengths and time lags for the signals at each station your network can triangulate your position and work out where you are this is true whenever your phone is switched on whether you re using it or not because every so often it sends out a check signal to make sure everything is working as it should not surprisingly the phone network companies are shy about admitting they have this ability but within the industry it s seen as just one more piece of data there is even talk of selling the data to internet content providers so they can send information to your internet phone based on your location for example reviews of nearby restaurants the triangulation capability of cell phone network companies varies according to the age of their equipment a few can only do it manually with a big drain on skilled manpower but these days most companies can generate the information automatically which makes it cheap enough to sell check out link below to find out more
know your essay subject you must learn to write essays from an excess of knowledge go to lectures read up on the subject in the library look up the latest academic papers and thoroughly immerse yourself in the essay subject before writing without this work to find out the information you cannot write an essay with authority and command of your essay subject matter here are some tips to help you when you gather this information collect more information than you will use although your research will give you a mass of information you must use only the information that answers the question set you will probably collect a hundred facts read a dozen opinions and review three or four of the most recent academic discussions of the subject however to answer the question set you must cut this information down to the key facts most pertinent opinions and perhaps refer to only the most relevant discussion papers read primary sources first if you were writing an essay on the shakespeare s romeo and juliet you could not write a good one without first reading the play too often students ignore the primary source of material if you are writing an essay on rousseau s philosophy there s no excuse for not reading the original source contract rather than a critique of rousseau s writings studying the primary sources of information let you assess other information written on the subject use a systematic way of taking notes you need to have a method of note taking no matter how you record the information cards notebook or in a computer database bear the following in mind use a one word or two word key to each note this lets you sort them later and group related information together distinguish between primary and secondary sources an example of a primary source would by karl marx s das kapital a secondary source would be a critique of das kapital by another author distinguish between facts and opinions you must base your essay around facts without key facts you cannot present your arguments or assess other people s opinions look out for the ten key facts that are the backbone to your essay what information documents the subject and develops the ideas and arguments you are going to use look for quotable quotes too often lazy students quote chunks of text from documents rather than selecting the most important thought or view in fewer words don t write out extracts word for word your notes are notes not a copy of the words in the reference books keep a record of all information sources a record of each information source lets you find your source research material quickly helps you write up footnotes and reference lists

there is no typical way it s negotiated depending on your bargaining position vs the seller s which since the seller won t be helping on operations will be driven by how much the seller has into the business vs what you bring to the table seller wants out of operations so one big thing you bring to the table is your willingness to take over operations use this to ask for over of the profits but seller may not agree to this if s he has personally guaranteed restaurant obligations or has put a lot of money into it on how much typically gets put in that will depend on what kind of restaurant it is and where it s located here s some more info you need to make a rational decision any franchisor has to give a franchise circular generally known as a ufoc i e uniform franchise offering circular to the franchisee get a copy of that from the seller get copies of all financials for the past years and interim financials for jan and feb the financials will help answer this question but ask how much money the seller has personally put into the franchise since starting it also ask whether s he has personally guaranteed any loans leases or other restaurant liabilities and whether you ll be expected to do the same be extremely careful skeptical if you re expected to personally guaranty anything because often times a seller will want the buyer to do this so the seller can get off personal guarantees leaving buyer holding the bag ask if the restaurant is in default on any liabilities ask if there are any outstanding lawsuits against the restaurant you need a lawyer and maybe also a cpa to help you no way you should proceed without one you could really get burned i d contact a corporate lawyer in your area who has experience with franchise purchases generally speaking you d be looking at someone from a smaller firm since big firms charge a lot good luck

the hawaiian islands are volcanic in origin each island is made up of at least one primary volcano although many islands are composites of more than one the big island for instance is constructed of major volcanoes kilauea mauna loa mauna kea hualalai and kohala mauna loa is the largest active volcano on earth kilauea is presently one of the most productive volcanoes on earth in terms of how much lava it erupts each year the primary volcanoes on each of the islands are known as a shield volcanoes which are gently sloping mountains produced from a large number of generally very fluid lava flows hawaiian volcanoes primarily erupt a type of rock known as basalt when molten basalt produces liquids of relatively high fluidity compared to volcanoes that erupt more silica rich magma types such as andesite dacite or rhyolite the fluidity of molten basalt favors the formation of lava flows which is why the hawaiian volcanoes generally have gentle sloping sides by contrast lavas with higher silica content are more viscous and commonly produce either thicker shorter lava flows thick blocky deposits and or thick beds of ash that fall from the sky following explosive eruptions these other types of volcanoes common outside of hawaii are typically steeper sided the hawaiian volcanoes were produced by the hawaiian hot spot which is presently under the big island of hawaii the image below shows the islands of the hawaiian chain and the intervening shallows banks and reefs along a line from southeast to northwest note that the islands of lanai and kahoolawe are not shown because they would overlap with molokai and maui respectively see the map of the islands on the hawaiian volcanoes page in general when you move along the island chain from southeast hawaii to northwest kure the volcanoes become older and older more with diagras is available at the source

a company does not benefit directly by appreciation in its stock price a company s stock represents ownership interest in the company stock holders e g individual investors mutual funds etc own the stock of a company and therefore benefit when the stock price rises because now they can sell the stock for a higher price than before a company can indirectly benefit from stock price appreciation when company a acquires another company b the purchase price is usually paid in cash or company a s stock so if company a s stock price is higher then it could afford to pay more or buy more using its stock another benefit is employee moral many companies offer employees stock options stock grants or employee stock purchase plans to encourage employee ownership of company stock so when the company stock price rises the employees investment is worth more

if you will still have those two negative items on your credit report even if they are paid in full contact all credit bureaus immediately about those negative accounts tell them that those are the specific accounts that you are disputing and tell them that those accounts are wrong that they are now paid in full make sure to include information on the accounts such as the account numbers and the name of the company the three credit bureaus will have to investigate and they will find that you did in fact pay the accounts and they will change that on your credit report to showing that they are now paid in full whatever you do do not bother contacting the accounts that you paid in full and asking them to report to the credit bureaus that you paid them they will just jerk you around and say oh well it says in our records that we did report it when in fact they don t they got your money and they don t give a crap about the rest to take the time to report to the credit bureaus that you paid them so you will have to contact the credit bureaus yourself and let them know that it is incorrect if you don t know the three credit bureaus are equifax transunion and experian the phone number to transunion is experian is and equifax is it probably won t be enough to call them to dispute the information but you can call and ask for their mailing address then you will need to type up a letter to each credit bureau to tell them you are disputing the errors on your credit report to save you some time getting screwed around by the credit bureaus i recommend you include with your dispute letter a copy of your driver s license a copy of your social security card and proof of your current residency such as a copy of your current utility bills with your name on it sorry if it sounded like i ever repeated myself but i am just trying to save you some hastle in the long run because if you don t include all of those things along with the dispute letter right away the credit bureaus will just screw you around and keep sending you letters requesting more information and it will just take a longer process and you keep having to repeat the information you already sent to them if you haven t guessed i have gone through this already lol but the upside of this is the sooner you get this done the better and if you have any credit cards or other accounts just keep them up and try to keep as low of a balance as you can and keep paying your credit score will improve sometimes within months or so

identification tips watch for subflocks within any flock of geese one can find family groups and other subflocks sticking close together watching for these groups can aid identification by highlighting birds that are traveling together presumably from the same nesting area and quite possibly related in these cases it might be possible to identify the male larger and more alert the female and the young of a family group and once the age and sex is known impressions of size and color are somewhat more meaningful identifying a flock will usually be easier than identifying an individual bird beware of impressions and prejudices it is possible for two people to look at the same flock of geese and come away with very different impressions of the average appearance of those geese it is too easy to look at a flock pick out a few darker or paler birds and say yes this subspecies is normally darker paler than others while another observer could come away with the opposite impression guided by preconceptions or just by random chance even if the conclusion is accurate this subspecies averages darker that observation is of little use without more information on the range of variation and the percentage of birds that do not match the average such average statements are particularly useless when we are confronted by a solitary odd goose a thorough survey of each flock with some guidelines for judging color would be a more reliable and useful exercise and that kind of study has been sorely lacking in canada goose identification know what you are comparing to since identification requires judging subtle differences in average size and color it is critical to know your local flocks so that you can judge the relative size of an interesting bird against known subspecies this info is from the link below they offer more info than i thought existed about these geese enjoy

whether or not gps is used to perform a survey makes no difference in the quality of the survey a survey done with gps could be good or bad just like any other survey if you are trying to survey your own property using gps your work will not stand up in court since only surveys performed by licensed professional land surveyors can be presented as evidence if your neighbor has a survey done by a licensed professional and you do not agree with it you have no choice but to hire your own surveyor and let him know you are hiring him because you need help in a dispute if your neighbor has surveyed their property with gps and you have a survey done by a licensed professional then you have nothing to worry about since nothing your neighbor does with his gps unit can change your property assuming your neighbor is not a professional surveyor if there are two surveys both done by professional surveyors and they show different property line locations then you will need to either reach an agreement about the location of the line with your neighbor or if you cannot agree then you will need to go to court where a judge will decide which line is the true boundary

yes some businesses retain lawyers for a fixed amount per month it s called putting the atty on retainer in my experience retainer agreements are most common where there is an established relationship where the company has been working for the atty for a while so the atty can figure roughly how much work the client needs per month and there is established trust between both sides but that doesn t mean it couldn t work with an atty you haven t worked with before you d just need some of the basics agreed upon beforehand there is no set amount or set approach areas of negotiation are i the amount of the fee ii how many hours maximum will the atty be required to put in per month it wouldn t be fair for him or her to get and then be expected to give you hours of work and ii if you don t use the atty or use the atty minimally in a given month do you get a credit against next month s retainer let me add something that i m sure will rub some of my colleagues the wrong way although i think there is growing acceptance of this idea legal services for small companies are largely becoming commoditized there are a lot i don t know if too many but a lot of lawyers now and information which in the end is one of the few things a lawyer really has to offer is just so widely available to everyone over the internet what this means is there will probably more acceptance to your proposition than there would have been say years ago

here s the shot on that phenomena firstly i find no shame in this particular behavior and i let the world know that i profoundly enjoy and value feet things in general when younger i had all that going on without consciously realizing it was entirely normal stuff i thought that i might be the only one doing the slick stuff with feet like foot first then massage my way on up the leg okay let s look at the feet specializing sites numbering in the hundreds of millions xxxfoot do a search aside from that aside incidental i ll massage any fellows foot just one foot and that is done as a teaching example for sake of the women in this world so that that particular male will now have the physical knowledge of how to provide another female those same grand feelings it is important to work em feet firmly too for getting in at those wee wee muscles and tiny tendons i know i m gone on em and i reflect by this technique you women get the added benefits as it should be that male i presuppose will do some female s feet plural and enjoy em in hightened ways so yeah i do i honestly near worship the feminine foot and when i see a pair of em are also pretty i extra value those fortunate siightings while no female foot is ever disliked from birth through one hundred i enjoy my foot times that much more with the prettier they are and certainly that is normal too could be some form of feet worship going on without it being any particular religion but i do not think it is a question of that it s just you women got em pretty and you all are the sole mother s of our spieces and that in and of itself is absolutely awesome and worthy my highest regards i would not have ever been here ever had not one of you borne me need not i value her awesome feet and in a sense cherish those places her feet have traveled if enough gold were to be had from mining a valued coin should be placed where each time her sole has stepped or her toe pads have lightly touched so there was the shot ideally it has touched your question in some significant manner like when whenever bf gets at your feet rightly where you can recline for pleasuring in some wholly female times you will then know if he likes you enough for sending you there where you need be for sake of doing your breeding and or whatever feminine thing since all is entitled unto your kind of course all of this is applied differently accross the spectrum of people since so much is idiosyncratic behaviors amidst a myraid of diverse individual differences yet feet do have a big place in public media too and the female foot is not something to be taken lightly and before leaving you i please to also mention should any male face this feet stuff and the like squarely and straightforward and thusly leave unto you ladies the full complete rights of being her then it s a certainty your kind would have so much excess happiness that you would share the overflow with us if no overflow then where s it ever coming from anyhow you women need your complete happiness es while thinking and creating our blissful sexual worlds along with perpetually breeding i reflect you d each be as good wholesome nurses of your kind and would see to it there could be no discontented sad nor left behind baby but this slides into another person s question spell check is also having problems so kindly correct my blunderful errors have a nice day

you know i think the best way to answer that is to know someone going through it for instance say your sister is your best friend in the world everthing is fine until one day you get a call from her saying that she has be tested positive for hiv what s the first thing that will go through your mind now add the fact that the reason she has hiv is because she was in a collision a year or so prior and was injured she needed a blood transfusion and showed no symptoms she and her wonderful husband decide to have a child and as a routine check finds out that she was hiv positive now what do you think well i think that if the person i ve known all my life suddenly came down with a disease like cancer or had a heart attack i wouldn t stay away from him or her but try to understand them and help them if they need help i also imagine what it would be like not having them in my life just because i stayed away from them knowing they had heart disease yes i know that things like hiv can be passed on but seriously how are they going to pass it on to me in essence i think that if someone has hiv i should treat them as someone who doesn t as long as i m not planning on sleeping with them i hope that answered your question

you have an abstract of title showing copies of the documents affecting title to the land which you are the surface owner of i take it but the abstract is pretty old i imagine and not up to present day because getting abstracts nowadays is very expensive it used to be easy and we did it all the time there are a ccuple of different routes you can take here but be aware neither is inexpensive the first is to find a lawyer who specializes in real property law bring your abstract to the lawyer and tell him or her that you want to know who is the current mineral owner under your surface the lawyer can run or have run a title search to bring the title of the abstract current and then can render an opinion as to who the owner is another method is to go to a title company and see if you can pay them to bring the abstract current and tell you who they think owns the minerals usually title companies nowadays only like to work where real property is being bought or sold and they can sell title insurance but they might be able to steer you to someone who knows how to search and research title if they are not willing to do it otherwise your only choice is going to be to go yourself to the records of the county clerk and recorder get someone there to show you how the grantor grantee index works and try to do it yourself i don t recommend this method possibly you could try to find a petroleum landman these people are also women sometimes who do these types of title searches for a living again this is expensive a good field landman as this type of expert is called can easily ask for day as a rate good luck in your search

depending on your current size body mass index and metabolism this will vary with some degree one pound of fat is equal to calories so lbs calories since there are days in months you need to start eating more calories per day or in other words start eating a lot more food if it is muscle you want to gain hit the gym hard real hard it is possible to put on lbs of muscle in months time but really difficult if it is muscle you want to gain instead of just weight which i am assuming or at least hope is the case you need to up your calorie intake even higher to maybe calories more than what you re eating now most of this needs to be from high protein sources as your body will need this to build new muscle
talking is probably the largest factor i can think of to keep the other person interested in a conversation don t talk about yourself too much ask questions to get to know the person better talk about any interests you have classes guys girls parents etc becoming genuinely interested in the other person a somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn t like generally the other person will complain too and you ll have you re conversation you have to be very careful not to do this often because you don t want the other person to think you re a whiner pay attention to what the other person says this one is extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered continue to speak to everyone you know regularly if you are walking and see someone you haven t talked to in a while stop for a moment and talk to them it does not have to be a long conversation just say hello see how they are doing and if anything is wrong you would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them be nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note you don t have to make sure the other person has a great time every single conversation but you don t want to think of all the petty arguements they ve had with you arguements don t there are very few good arguements the only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it if you re wrong admit it do not critize the person or a friend when talking to the person if you want to point out something they did wrong try to point out something similar you did wrong smile not a forced smile the person you re talking to will be able to tell the difference and you don t have to be an overly happy hyper active person just smile naturally and if you can be somewhat happy remembering good times with your friends family can help let the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener somewhat stated in my first advice ask questions talk about interests the other person has answer questions sincerly honestly make the person you re talking to feel important you don t want to fake this one or do it too often but if you honestly think they did something well give them that praise if you want more advice there are a couple good books that will actually help how to win friends and influence people is probably one of the best ones it s an old book but trust me it s just as useful today as it was when it was written
